== Geo Features -- Areas, limits

[[sec_16.1]]
=== International boundaries and national limits (see S-4 -- B-440)

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), 1982 came into force on 16 November 1994. UNCLOS contains navigational provisions as well as provisions for determining the limits of various maritime zones. These provisions are binding to all states that have ratified the Convention. For technical aspects of UNCLOS, see IHO publication C-51.

IHO Member States should show, on selected series of their ENCs, their own baseline and maritime limits in accordance with UNCLOS.

The Mariner may be interested in the exact location of international maritime boundaries for two principal reasons:

* When crossing a boundary they could be subject to different laws and regulations which may affect their navigation; for example buoyage systems, pilotage regulations, fishing rights, reporting procedures, pollution regulations.

* Where a boundary passes through groups of offshore islands they may wish to know upon which side of the boundary a particular island falls.

=== Maritime jurisdiction areas

.Maritime jurisdiction areas in constrained waters
image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_de8ddfa.png["",569,329]

The clauses in Section 16 below provide guidance for the encoding of maritime jurisdiction areas. Occasionally, these "areas" may actually be defined as linear due to international treaties; or the areas may not be fully defined and it may therefore be necessary to encode the boundary as a linear feature (see example at Figure 16-3 below). Clause 2.3 defining features permitted for use in ENC and their geometric primitives allows relevant feature classes relating to maritime jurisdiction areas to be encoded as type curve; however this must only be done in circumstances where it is not possible to encode the feature using geometric primitive surface.

[[fig_16-3]]
.Maritime jurisdiction -- areas cannot be defined
image::figure-16-3.png[]

In Figure 16-3, Administration Areas A and B cannot be encoded using geometric primitive surface as the seaward edge of the areas is not defined. In this case, the section of the international boundary extending seaward from the low water line should be encoded as an *Administration Area* feature of type curve (see clause 16.8).

[[sec_16.2.1]]
==== Maritime jurisdiction areas in dispute

In accordance with Article 55 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS -- 10 December 1982), a Coastal State's Territorial Sea Area and Exclusive Economic Zone must not overlap. Occasionally, small areas at the boundary of two or more Coastal States may be in dispute regarding the establishment of maritime jurisdiction, which may result in a small section of Territorial Sea overlapping an EEZ in the disputed area.

Where issues of maritime jurisdiction between two or more Coastal States are in dispute, the proposed Territorial Sea (*Territorial Sea Area*) of one Coastal State may overlap the proposed EEZ (*Exclusive Economic Zone*) of another Coastal State. In this case, the disputed area should be encoded with separate *Territorial Sea Area* and *Exclusive Economic Zone* features, with Boolean attribute *in dispute* set to _True_ and the mandatory attribute *nationality* populated with the country codes (conforming to ISO 3166) of the disputing states (see clause27.135).

==== Anchorages (see S-4 -- B-431.1; B-431.3 and B-431.7)

Where the limits of anchorages are defined by a regulatory authority (for example harbour authority) they must be shown on the largest optimum display scale ENC data. They may also be shown on other optimum display scale ENC datasets where useful, for example, for planning purposes.

If it is required to encode an anchorage area, including anchorages for seaplanes, it must be done using the feature *Anchorage Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The complex attribute **feature name**, sub-attribute *name*is used to encode the name and/or number of the *Anchorage Area*.
* The complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) may be used to provide additional information about the category of anchorage, where required.
* Individual recommended anchorages without defined limits should be encoded as *Anchorage Area* features of type point, with attributes *category of anchorage* = _1_ (unrestricted anchorage) and *status* = _3_ (recommended).
* If it is required to encode an anchorage at a location that has not been defined by a regulatory authority but has been reported to be suitable and safe for anchoring, this must be done using *Anchorage Area* of type point, with attribute *category of anchorage* = _15_ (reported anchorage). NOTE: the encoding of *Anchorage Area* with attribute *category of anchorage* = _15_ (reported anchorage) of type surface is prohibited.
* If it is required to encode an anchorage which may be used for a period of not more than 24 hours, it must be done using *category of anchorage* = _9_ (anchorage for periods up to 24 hours).
* If it is required to encode an anchorage with a specific, limited time period, it must be done using *category of anchorage* = _10_ (anchorage for limited period of time). The specific limit of time should be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6), sub-attribute *text* (for example_Anchorage limited to 12 hours_).
* Areas with numerous small craft moorings may be encoded using the feature *Mooring Area* (see clause 16.4). For the encoding of mooring buoys, see clause 20.8.
* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.
* Areas where anchoring is prohibited must be encoded, where required, as *Restricted Area* (see clause 17.8) with attribute *restriction* = _1_ (anchoring prohibited).

==== Dumping grounds (see S-4 -- B-442; B-446 and B-446.1)

Materials deliberately dumped at sea in specified areas (other than those associated with reclamation works) may be classified, according to their significance to the Mariner, as follows:

** Materials which are generally dispersed before reaching the seabed, for example sewage sludge, are of little navigational significance and no charting action is usually required.
** Spoil from dredging operations or other works which might reduce charted depths significantly in the designated spoil ground.
** Harmful materials, including explosives and chemicals, which are likely to remain concentrated on the seabed.
Dumping of harmful materials is unlikely to affect depths substantially and such dumping grounds are encoded primarily as a warning against anchoring, trawling or other submarine operations.

If it is required to encode a dumping ground, it must be done using the feature *Dumping Ground*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* A *Dumping Ground* feature of type surface must be covered by features from Skin of the Earth as appropriate (*Depth Area* or *Unsurveyed Area*).
* Disused dumping grounds for harmful materialsare considered dangerous for an indefinite period and must therefore be encoded on the largest optimum display scale ENC datasets, with attribute *status* = _4_ (not in use). The date when the area ceased to be used may be populated using the attribute **date disused**, if known.
* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.

[[sec_16.7.2]]
==== Spoil grounds, dredging areas (see S-4 -- B-446)

Spoil grounds are areas set aside, clear of shipping channels and in deep water where possible, for the disposal of material (spoil) generally obtained by dredging. Their significance to the Mariner is that very large quantities of material may be dumped, decreasing the depth of water available. Where possible, charts should be updated in a timely manner so as to include the latest survey information covering the spoil ground.

Extraction (or dredging) areas are those areas where a concentration of dredging vessels may be encountered, taking up sand or shingle to be brought ashore (for example for construction purposes). Their significance is primarily as a collision hazard, although they also indicate the likelihood of finding a greater depth of water than charted. Channels dredged to provide an adequate depth of water for navigation are "dredged areas", not to be confused with "dredging areas".

If it is required to encode a spoil ground, it must be done using a *Dumping Ground* feature, with attribute *category of dumping ground* = _5_ (spoil ground).

If it is required to encode a dredging area, it must be done using a *Restricted Area* feature (see clause 17.8), with attribute *category of restricted area* = _21_ (dredging area). An area in which seabed material (for example sand, shingle) is being extracted for purposes such as construction must be encoded, where required, using the feature *Offshore Production Area* (see clause 14.6), with attribute *category of production area* = _13_ (seabed material extraction area).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Within a spoil ground; if the depths within the area are liable to be very much less than charted after the discharge of spoil and post-dumping surveys are not available, they may be treated as unsurveyed areas (see clause11.10), in which case soundings and depth contours may be omitted from the area. Alternatively, an indication of the discrepancy between charted depth information and the actual depths within the spoil ground may be provided by downgrading the information included in the underlying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature (see clause 3.8).

[underline]#Distinction:# Dredged Area.

==== Military practice areas (see S-4 -- B-441.1-6)

Military practice (or exercise) areas at sea are of various types and may be classified as follows with regard to their significance for the Mariner:

* Firing danger areas, sometimes called firing practice areas; that is, permanent or temporary ranges, including bombing, torpedo and missile ranges.
* Mine-laying practice (and counter-measures) areas.
* Submarine exercise areas.
* Other exercise areas.
Some degree of restrictionon navigation and other rights may be implied by the encoding of military practice areas. There may be varying interpretations of the validity of the restrictions and possible infringement of the rights of innocent passage through territorial waters and elsewhere. Where it is thought desirable to depict such areas, even though clear range procedure may be observed, or the areas appear to be a derogation of the freedom of the seas, Mariners should be informed (not necessarily on ENCs) that publication of the details of a law or regulation is solely for the safety and convenience of shipping and implies no recognition of the international validity of the law or regulation. By this means infringements are not condoned but the Mariner receives a warning which may be necessary for their safety.

If it is required to encode a military practice area, it must be done using the feature *Military Practice Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.
* Submarine exercise areas should generally not be encoded where submarines exercise over wide areas which it would not be practicable to depict, and over which cautions (to keep a good look out for them) are unlikely to be effective. They may, however, be encoded where they occur in or near major shipping lanes or port approaches.
* Firing danger areas at seaare frequently marked by IALA special buoys sometimes laid around the perimeter of the area and/or by specially erected lights, beacons and targets. If required, all such features which could assist the navigator in identifying their position, or could be a hazard, must be encoded in the normal way,
* The existence of mine laying (and counter-measures/clearance) practice areas implies the possibility of unexploded mines or depth charges on the seafloor, and also the presence of harmless practice mines.

[underline]#Distinction:# Caution Area; Restricted Area; Submarine Transit Lane.

==== International and national territories (see S-4 -- B-440.1 and B-440.3)

International maritime boundariesare those which have been established by agreement between adjacent or opposite States. Boundaries are sometimes negotiated on the basis of the equidistance or "median" line principle. For various reasons, however, agreed boundaries even when negotiated on this principle are seldom true median lines. Navigationally, international boundaries may vary in their significance over different parts of their lengths. Inshore, they may represent the delimitation of Territorial Seas of two states or "internal waters", (for example within bay closing lines or straight baseline systems). Offshore, they may represent Exclusive Economic Zone and/or Continental Shelf boundaries.

If it is required to encode a named international or national territory, it must be done using the feature *Administration Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* International land boundaries should be encoded, at least in the vicinity of coasts.
* *Administration Area* must only be encoded using the geometric primitive curve where the real-world instance is actually linear, and it is therefore not possible to encode the feature using the geometric primitive surface. See clause 16.2.

==== Cargo transhipment areas (see S-4 -- B-449.4)

Areas generally outside port limits may be specifically designated as suitable for the transhipment of oil or other materials from large ships to smaller vessels. The areas selected are relatively sheltered locations and lie off main shipping routes. As the purpose of transhipment is usually to reduce the draught of the larger vessel to allow it to proceed to port, the operation is often known as "lightening" and the areas may be known as "lightening areas" or "cargo transfer areas".

If it is required to encode a cargo transhipment area, it must be done using the feature *Cargo Transhipment Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.
* The encoding of cargo transhipment areas should be adequate to warn other vessels of the likelihood of encountering ships restricted in their ability to manoeuvre. Regulations governing the use of such areas should be encoded using the attribute *restriction* or the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).

==== Caution areas (see S-4 -- B-242)

If it is required to identify an area in which the Mariner must be aware of circumstances influencing the safety of navigation (for example an area of continually changing depths), and which cannot be encoded using other feature types, it must be done using the feature *Caution Area*. This feature may be required to identify a danger, a risk, a rule or advice that is not directly related to a particular feature.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If the information applies to a specific area the *Caution Area* feature should cover only that area.
* If the information to be encoded is spatially linear, this should be encoded using a "very narrow" *Caution Area* feature of type surface (approximately 0·3mm wide at the optimum display scale of the ENC data).
* Information which may be of use to the Mariner, but is not significant to safe navigation and cannot be encoded using other feature types, should be encoded using an *Information Area* feature (see clause 16.12). This encoding is intended to reduce the number of alarms or indications generated in the ECDIS due to the overuse of *Caution Area* features.
* Notes should be kept to a minimum and be as concise as is compatible with accuracy and intelligibility. Hydrographic terminology (jargon) should be avoided, giving preference to easily understood words, for example "depths" rather than "bathymetry".
* In order to ensure correct ECDIS display, *Caution Area* features of type surface should not share the geometry of features such as *Depth Contour* and other features with higher ECDIS display priorities (that is, higher than display priority 3), as the *Caution Area* will appear to be "open ended", which may confuse the Mariner. Where this occurs, the edge of the *Caution Area* should be extended outward to clear the "shared" edge, sufficient to avoid "duplicate geometry" validation errors (that is, at least 0.3mm at the optimum display scale for the ENC data).

==== Exclusive Economic Zones (see S-4 -- B-440.9)

In the Exclusive Economic Zone, the coastal State has sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether living or non-living, of the waters superjacent to the seabed and of the seabed and its subsoil, and with regard to other activities for the economic exploitation and exploration of the Zone, such as the production of energy from the water, currents and winds.

If it is required to encode an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), it must be done using the feature *Exclusive Economic Zone*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* *Exclusive Economic Zone* must only be encoded using the geometric primitive curve where the real-world instance is actually linear, and it is therefore not possible to encode the feature using the geometric primitive surface. See clause 16.2.
* For guidance regarding the encoding of areas in which the maritime jurisdiction between two or more Coastal States are in dispute, see clause 16.2.1.

==== Fishery zones (see S-4 -- B-440.7)

A fishery zoneis an area inside and beyond the Territorial Sea where a coastal State proclaims that it alone may regulate fishing. Where States have permitted others to fish in parts of the area, it may be desirable to encode the area of both the full area and the area of special concessionary rights. In some instances, claims are described as "conservation zones"; for practical purposes these may be classed with fishery zones since their intended function is to institute fishery conservation measures. Most of the fishery zone claims are limited by fixed distance (200 nautical miles in some cases) from the Territorial Sea baselines.

If it is required to encode a fishery zone, it must be done using the feature *Fishery Zone*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Fishery zones commonly coincide with other national jurisdiction areas such as Continental Shelf and Exclusive Economic Zone. Where this occurs, Producing Authorities may choose to omit the *Fishery Zone* from the area covered by these other national jurisdiction areas, as the fact that fishing regulations apply in these areas is implicit.
* An indication of the fishery zone limit (for example 6 mile, 12 mile) may be encoded using the complex attribute *feature name*.

==== Straight Territorial Sea Baselines (see S-4 -- B-440.4)

A Territorial Sea is delimited by:

* Territorial Sea Baselines (drying lines);
* Straight Territorial Sea Baselines;
* International maritime boundaries (see clause 16.1); and
* Seaward limits of Territorial Seas (see clause 16.2).
The term "Baseline" refers to the line from which the breadth of the Territorial Sea, the outer limits of the Contiguous Zone, the Exclusive Economic Zone and, in some cases, the Continental Shelf are measured. It is also the dividing line between internal watersand territorial seas. Internal waters comprise all areas of the sea on the landward side of the Territorial Sea Baselines, as well as inland waters including rivers, lakes, etc.

The normal baselineis the low water line (which is not defined any more precisely by UNCLOS) of the mainland, islands, or low tide elevations, as depicted on large scale charts officially recognised by the coastal State; they therefore do not require depiction in ENCs. Features which are naturally-formed and dry at low water (for example rocks, reefs, sand banks) may be considered low-tide elevations and included in the baseline (details are given in UNCLOS - see IHO publication C-51).

A straight baselinemay be used:

* as a closing line across the mouth or estuary of a river;
* as a closing line across the mouth of a juridical bay or a historical bay;
* as part of a system of Straight Territorial Sea Baselines, for example to connect seaward points on a deeply indented coastline, a coastline that is fringed with islands, around unstable coastlines; or
* as an archipelagic baseline.
If it is required to encode a Straight Territorial Sea Baseline, it must be done using the feature *Straight Territorial Sea Baseline*.

* International maritime boundaries (see clause 16.2); and
* Seaward limits of Territorial Seas.
Within the Territorial Sea, a coastal State exercises sovereignty subject to rules of international law, including the right of innocent passage for foreign ships.

If it is required to encode a Territorial Sea area, it must be done using the feature *Territorial Sea Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.
* *Territorial Sea Area* must only be encoded using the geometric primitive curve where the real-world instance is actually linear, and it is therefore not possible to encode the feature using the geometric primitive surface. See clause 16.2.
* For guidance regarding the encoding of areas in which the maritime jurisdiction between two or more Coastal States are in dispute, see clause 16.2.1.

Submarine transit lanes should not generally be encoded because submarines exercise over wide areas which it would not be practicable to depict, and over which cautions (to keep a good look out for them) are unlikely to be effective. They may, however, be encoded where they occur in or near major shipping lanes or port approaches.

If it is required to encode a submarine transit lane, it must be done using the feature *Submarine Transit Lane*.

If it is required to encode an area subject to marine pollution regulations as defined in IMO MARPOL, IMO conventions and various national regulations, it must be done using the feature *Marine Pollution Regulations Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The regulation title should be encoded using the complex attribute **feature name**, sub-attribute **name**, for example _IMO MARPOL Annex IV -- Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Sewerage from Ships_.
* If it is required to encode the national regulation citation it must be done using the attribute *regulation citation*. The regulation citation is generally the national legal citation for the implementation of an international regulation (for example _33 CFR 33_).
* A short summary of the regulation and a reference to the publication containing the regulation must be included using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).

[underline]#Distinction:# Administration Area.

== Geo Features -- Restricted Areas -- Overview

There are many types of areas within which certain activities are discouraged or prohibited, or from which certain classes of vessels are excluded. The general term for all areas in which certain aspects of navigation may be restricted or prohibited by regulations is "Restricted Area", or equivalent. The word "prohibited", or its equivalent, may appear in terms relating to activities which are contrary to the regulations, for example "Anchoring Prohibited", "Entry Prohibited".

If it is required to encode a restricted area, it must be done using the feature *Restricted Area* (see clause 17.8); or using other features having the attribute *restriction* (**Anchorage Area**, **Cable Area**, **Cargo Transhipment Area**, **Dumping Ground**, **Dredged Area**, **Deep Water Route Part**, **Fairway**, **Fishing Ground**, **Harbour Facility**, **Inshore Traffic Zone**, **Marine Farm/Culture**, **Military Practice Area**, **Offshore Production Area**, **Submarine Pipeline Area**, **Pipeline Submarine/On Land**, **Precautionary Area**, **Seaplane Landing Area**, **Submarine Transit Lane**, **Territorial Sea Area**, **Traffic Separation Scheme Crossing**, **Traffic Separation Scheme Lane Part**, *Traffic Separation Scheme Roundabout*).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The attribute *category of restricted area* is used to describe the reason for the regulation, while the attribute *restriction* describes the restrictions.
* The complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) may be used to provide an additional explanation about the regulation (for example the equivalent to a caution note from a paper chart), where required.
* An area in which regulations apply due to recreation activities such as water skiing, jet skiing, kite surfing and rowing must be encoded, where required, as *Restricted Area* with *category of restricted area* = _32_ (recreation area).
* If it is required to encode an area for which the Mariner must be made aware of circumstances influencing the safety of navigation, it must be done using the feature *Caution Area* (see clause16.10). This feature may be used to identify a danger, a risk, a rule or advice (for example an area of continually changing depths) which is not directly related to a particular feature.

[[sec_17.1]]
=== Minefields (see S-4 -- B-441.8)

If it is required to encode a minefield, it must be done using a *Restricted Area* feature (see clause17.8), with attribute *category of restricted area* = _14_ (minefield). Former mined areas should also be encoded with attribute *status* = _4_ (not in use).

[[sec_17.2]]
=== Degaussing ranges (see S-4 -- B-448)

A degaussing (or demagnetising) range is an area, usually of about 0.2M diameter, within which ships' magnetic fields may be measured. Sensing instruments and cables are installed on the seafloor in the range and there are cables leading from the range to a control position ashore. The range is usually marked by distinctive buoys. The significance of a degaussing range to Mariners is that anchoring and trawling are prohibited and that the range may have to be avoided when vessels are using it.

If it is required to encode a degaussing range, it must be done using a *Restricted Area* feature (see clause17.8), with attribute *category of restricted area* = _8_ (degaussing range).

[[sec_17.3]]
=== Nature reserves (see S-4 -- B-437.3)

If it is required to encode a marine nature reserve area, it must be done using a *Restricted Area* feature (see clause17.8), with attribute *category of restricted area* = _4_ (nature reserve).

[[sec_17.4]]
=== Speed limits (see S-4 -- B-430.2)

Speed is often limited inside harbours in order to prevent wakes. If it is required to encode this restriction, it must be done usinga *Restricted Area* feature (see clause17.8), with the attribute *category of restricted area* = _24_ (no wake area) or *restriction* = _13_ (no wake). If it is required to encode cases where the speed limit is known in general or for a certain class(es) of vessel, it must be done using a *Restricted Area*or using other features having the attribute *restriction* (see clause 17 above) and having*restriction* = _27_ (speed restricted), with the speed limit, speed units and, if appropriate, the class of vessel, encoded using an instance of the complex attribute **vessel speed limit**, sub-attributes **speed limit**, *speed units* and *vessel class*. Further detailed information regarding speed limits, for example varying speed limits based on vessel length, draught or cargo, may be encoded, if required, using the complex attribute **information**; or using the attribute *pictorial representation* (for example, to reproduce the graphic for a speed restriction table contained in a Nautical Publication).

If it is required to encode the buoys/beacons marking the *Restricted Area* feature with speed limits, it must be done using *Special Purpose/General Beacon*or *Special Purpose/General Buoy* features (see clauses20.13and 20.5 respectively), with the attribute *category of special purpose mark* = _24_ (reduced wake mark) or _25_ (speed limit mark). The speed limit and its unit of measurement should be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6), sub-attribute *text* (for example _Speed limit is 6 knots_).

[[sec_17.5]]
=== Anchoring restricted (see S-4 -- B-431.4)

If it is required to encode a restricted anchoring area, it must be done using a *Restricted Area* feature (see clause17.8), or using other features with the attribute *restriction* (see clause17), where *restriction* = _1_ (anchoring prohibited) or _2_ (anchoring restricted). Additional information about the restriction should be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).

[[sec_17.6]]
=== Areas to be avoided (see S-4 -- B-435.7)

If it is required to encode an IMO Area to be Avoided, it must be done using a *Restricted Area* feature (see clause17.8), with attribute *restriction* = _14_ (area to be avoided). An IMO Area to be Avoided around a navigational aid must also be encoded with attribute *category of restricted area* = _12_ (navigational aid safety zone).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Areas other than IMO Area to be Avoided for which entry is prohibited or restricted should be encoded using the **Restricted Area**, having values *restriction* = _7_ (entry prohibited) or _8_ (entry restricted).

[[sec_17.7]]
=== Environmentally Sensitive Sea Areas (see S-4 -- B-437)

Environmentally Sensitive Sea Areas (ESSA) should be included on ENCs where there is a specifically identified requirement, and where it is practicable, given the optimum display scale of the ENC data and the extent of the ESSA. If there is no such requirement, or if it is not practicable, details of ESSA should only be inserted in associated publications, such as Sailing Directions. It should be noted that the inclusion of ESSA on smaller optimum display scale of the ENC data may be appropriate for voyage planning purposes.

If it is required to encode an Environmentally Sensitive Sea Area, it must be done using a *Restricted Area* feature (see clause 17.8), with attribute *category of restricted area* = _27_ (ESSA) or _28_ (PSSA).

An Environmentally Sensitive Sea Area that is shown on the source as a point symbol should be encoded using a small surfacerestricted area feature__.__

== Geo Features -- Aids to Navigation -- Overview

In the context of this Product Specification, the following generic term definitions apply:

*Beacon:* A fixed artificial navigation mark that can be recognised by its shape, colour, pattern, topmark or light character, or a combination of these. It may carry various additional aids to navigation. This term is not commonly used when the navigation mark can be classified as a lighthouse. (IHO Dictionary - S-32).

*Buoy:* A floating object moored to the bottom in a particular (charted) place, as an aid to navigation or for other specific purposes. Navigational buoys may be classified according to: (a) their shape, appearance, or construction, such as barrel, can, cask, conical, cylindrical, dan, keg, nun, pillar, spar, spherical, or topmark buoy; (b) their colour, such as black, chequered, green, red buoy; (c) their location, such as bifurcation, fairway, junction, mid-channel, middle-ground, or turning buoy; (d) the various kinds of hazards or dangers to navigation which they mark, such as bar, isolated danger, fish trap, obstruction, spoil ground, telegraph or wreck buoy; (e) their particular purpose or use, such as anchor, anchorage, compass adjustment, dredging, farewell (or landfall), marker, quarantine, station (or watch), or warping buoy. (IHO Dictionary - S-32).

[[sec_18.1]]
=== Geo features forming parts of navigational aids

Aids to navigation are composed of fixed or floating structure features established specifically as an aid to navigation, which may carry equipment features.

When identifying relationships (associations) between aids to navigation and associated geo features within this document, three "base classes" are used to define the aids to navigation geo features included in the relevant association. These "base classes" are:

* Structure Features: Includes **Cardinal Beacon**, **Cardinal Buoy**, **Daymark**, **Emergency Wreck Marking Buoy**, **Installation Buoy**, **Isolated Danger Beacon**, **Isolated Danger Buoy**, **Lateral Beacon**, **Lateral Buoy**, **Light Float**, **Light Vessel**, **Landmark**, **Pile**, **Safe Water Beacon**, **Safe Water Buoy**, **Special Purpose/General Beacon**, *Special Purpose/General Buoy*.
* Equipment Features: Includes **Daymark**, **Fog Signal**, *Helipad* (exceptionally, see 2^nd^ Remarks bullet below), **Light Air Obstruction**, **Light All Around**, **Light Fog Detector**, **Light Sectored**, **Physical AIS Aid to Navigation**, **Radar Reflector**, **Radar Transponder Beacon**, **Retroreflector**, **Signal Station Traffic**, *Signal Station Warning*.
* Navigational Aid Features: Includes **Cardinal Beacon**, **Cardinal Buoy**, **Daymark**, **Emergency Wreck Marking Buoy**, **Installation Buoy**, **Isolated Danger Beacon**, **Isolated Danger Buoy**, **Lateral Beacon**, **Lateral Buoy**, **Light Float**, **Light Vessel**, **Pile**, **Safe Water Beacon**, **Safe Water Buoy**, **Special Purpose/General Beacon**, *Special Purpose/General Buoy*.

The encoding of relationships between structure and equipment features is described in clause 18.2.

[underline]#Remarks:# Exceptionally,

* Structures that have not been established specifically as an aid to navigation may also carry aids to navigation as equipment features. These include **Bridge**, **Building**, **Cable Overhead**, **Conveyor**, **Crane**, **Dolphin**, **Floating Dock**, **Fortified Structure**, **Fishing Facility**, **Hulk**, **Landmark**, **Offshore Platform**, **Pipeline Overhead**, **Pontoon**, **Pylon/Bridge Support**, **Obstruction**, **Shoreline Construction**, **Silo/Tank**, **Span Fixed**, **Span Opening**, **Wind Turbine**, *Wreck*. If it is required to encode such supporting structures at the same location as an equipment feature, it must be encoded as a separate feature, and share the same spatial type as (for point structures), or cover the location of (for structures of type curve or area) the equipment feature.
* Substantive structures, which may carry helipads, erected in the water and intended to perform the function of light support must be encoded, where required, using the feature *Landmark* (see clauses 7.2 and 25.16). Exceptionally, *Helipad* features may also, if required, be associated to **Building**, *Landmark* or *Offshore Platform* features that do not additionally perform the function of a support for an aid to navigation, using the feature association *Structure/Equipment* (see clause 18.2).
* Topmarks are encoded as part of the navigational aid structure, using the complex attribute *topmark* (see clause 29.34).
* Radar reflectors must not be encoded as separate features when attached to navigational aids. If it is required to encode their existence, it must be done by populating the Boolean attribute *radar conspicuous* = _True_. Radar reflectors may only be encoded where their position is known and they are included as equipment features on an overhead cable structure feature (see clauses 6.10.1, 20.18.1 and 25.15).
* Rescue stations and coast guard stations are not related to navigation, and they must not, therefore, be part of the equipment features of navigational aids. If it is required to encode a rescue or coast guard station at the same location as a navigational mark, it must be encoded as a separate feature, and share the same spatial type as the navigational aid.

Structure Features

**Navigational Aid**

**Structure/Equipment** feature association (see clause 25.16) must be created in order to relate the different features comprising a navigational aid. Where a *Structure/Equipment* feature association is created, there must be only one structure feature related to one or more equipment features. An equipment feature must not be related to more than one structure feature.

[[fig_18-1]]
.Navigational aids -- Structure/equipment association
image::figure-18-1.png[]

Note that *Daymark* may be a structure feature or an equipment feature (refer to the lists of structure and equipment features at clause 18.1); where a navigational aid contains a *Daymark* and there is no other base structure (which can serve as the structure feature) indicated on the source, the *Daymark* feature should be encoded as the structure feature. A single *Daymark* feature instance must not be both a structure and an equipment feature.

When the nature of the base structure on land is unknown or there is no structure feature, one of the equipment features may be chosen as the structure feature, giving priority to a *Light All Around* or *Light Sectored* feature, if one exists (however, see also clause 19.1.8). Where this occurs, the light feature must be encoded as the structure feature in the *Structure/Equipment* relationship. Alternatively, a *Pile* feature of type point or a *Special Purpose/General Beacon* feature may be encoded as the structure feature at the same position as the equipment features. When a light is located in the water with no indication on the source of the structure feature, regardless of the height of the light, a *Pile* feature of type surface or a *Special Purpose/General Beacon* feature should be encoded as the structure feature. This will ensure that a symbol will be shown on ECDIS systems when the light features are not displayed during daytime navigation.

[[fig_18-2]]

image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_36764e87.png["",561,240]

In the above real-world examples, the structure and equipment features that make up the navigational aids are point spatial types, and they mustshare the same geographic point spatial type.

If it is required to encode the name of the navigational aid, it must be done using the complex attribute *feature name* (see clause 2.5.8) on the structure feature. The name must not be repeated for the equipment features. If the name is painted on the structure, it must be encoded with the same spelling in the complex attribute *feature name*. If the name is not based on the Latin alphabet, it must be encoded using *feature name* (*name*), with an appropriate value populated for the sub-attribute **language**, and transliterated for encoding on an iteration of *feature name* (*name*) with an appropriate value populated for the mandatory attribute *language* (normally English (_eng_)).

All point features comprising a navigational aid must share the same geographic point spatial instance.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For guidance related to the population of the temporal attributes *date end* and *date start* for equipment features in a *Structure/Equipment* association relationship, see clause 2.4.9.

[[sec_18.3]]
=== Buoyage systems and direction of buoyage (see S-4 -- B-461)

Systems of buoyage are described as lateral, cardinal, or a combination of lateral and cardinal. Lateral systems depend on a direction of buoyage being defined. The cardinal system depends solely on the main points of the compass. Special purpose buoys often mark the limits or centre of an area (for example an exercise area, a dumping ground) and do not necessarily have lateral or cardinal system characteristics.

The IALA Maritime Buoyage Systemdetails, including the extent of Regions A and B, are given in other publications (for example UK's booklet NP 735 "IALA Maritime Buoyage System"). Although it is called a buoyage system, it applies to all fixed and floating marks except lighthouses, some sector lights, leading lights and marks, major floating lights and lights on offshore structures. Six types of marks are provided by the system: Lateral, Cardinal, Isolated danger, Safe water, Special and Emergency Wreck Marking marks, which may be used in any combination.

[[sec_18.3.1]]
==== Buoyage systems and direction of buoyage (see S-4 -- B-461)

The buoyage system of the area covered by the dataset and, where necessary, the direction of buoyage, must be encoded using the Meta features *Navigational System of Marks* and *Local Direction of Buoyage*:

All parts of the dataset containing data must be covered by *Navigational System of Marks* features (see clause 3.6), with the mandatory attribute *marks navigational -- system of* indicating the buoyage system in operation. *Navigational System of Marks* features must not overlap.

Within a dataset, there may be some areas where the direction of buoyage is defined by local rules and must, therefore, be specified. These areas should be encoded asseparate*Local Direction of Buoyage* features (see clause 3.7), with the mandatory attribute *orientation value* indicating the direction of buoyage. *Local Direction of Buoyage* features must not overlap, but in areas where local buoyage directions apply, *Local Direction of Buoyage* features must overlap *Navigational System of Marks* features (see Figure 18-3 below).

[[fig_18-3]]
.Buoyage system and direction
image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_e86edc1e.gif[Shape36,492,210]

Individual buoys and beacons may not be part of the general buoyage system. This should be encoded using the attribute *marks navigational -- system of* on these buoy and beacon features.

[[sec_18.3.1.1]]
===== Encoding IALA marks within IALA A or B

In the following Tables the symbol '/' indicates that this attribute is not relevant for that particular feature class. The Tables contain the most common examples of encoding; other encoding combinations are possible. For encoding of buoys, substitute *Buoy* for *Beacon * in the Feature column. Table 18-3 for topmarks refers to the sub-attribute values for the complex attribute *topmark*.

\* If it is required to encode an aid to navigation that may be considered to be a topmark but has multiple colours that are considered important for navigation, this should be done using the feature *Daymark* (see clause 20.14).

[[sec_19]]
== Geo Features -- Lights

For the purpose of encoding lights in ENC, the following features must be used, depending on the type of light:

* *Light All Around* (see clause 19.2) for lights having the same character over the whole horizon of interest to marine navigation (all-round lights)), excluding fog detector and air obstruction lights;
* *Light Sectored* (see clause 19.3) for lights having one or more sectors which have different characteristics, including directional lights and lights having obscured or partially obscured sectors;
* *Light Fog Detector* (see clause 19.4) for lights used to automatically determine conditions of visibility which warrant the turning on or off of a sound signal; and
* **Light Air Obstruction** (see clause 19.5) for lights marking an obstacle which constitutes a danger to air navigation.

When encoding a light, the combination of the character and purpose of the light must be evaluated in order to determine the most appropriate light feature from the above list.

[[sec_19.1]]
=== Lights: General

[[sec_19.1.1]]
==== Rhythms of lights (see S-4 -- B-471.2)

The principal character of a light is its rhythm (although, strictly, fixed lights and some alternating lights are not "rhythmic").

If it is required to encode the rhythms of lights, this must be done using the complex attribute **rhythm of light**, sub-attributes *light characteristic* and *signal group*. When populating **rhythm of light**, the sub-attributes **signal group**, *signal period* and *signal sequence* are only valid for non-fixed lights (that is, sub-attribute *light characteristic* ≠ _1_ (fixed)), with *signal group* and *signal period* being mandatory.

The use of these sub-attributes is defined in the following Table; it contains the most common examples of coding; other coding combinations are possible:

|===

Some lights recently constructed may appear to the Mariner as "fixed and flashing - FFL" by night, while the real-world feature actually comprises two separate lights vertically disposed, one fixed and the other flashing (F&Fl). When it is known that two separate features actually exist, they must be encoded as separate light features, in this case two *Light All Around* features, one with complex attribute **rhythm of light**, sub-attribute *light characteristic* = _1_ (fixed) and the other with *light characteristic* = _2_ (flashing), and not as one *Light**All Around* with *light characteristic* = _13_ (fixed/flash).

[[sec_19.1.2]]
==== Types and functions of lights (see S-4 -- B-471.1)

If it is required to encode types and functions of lights, this must be done using the attribute *category of light* (see clause 27.37).

[[sec_19.1.3]]
==== Elevations of lights (see S-4 -- B-471.6)

The elevationof a light is the vertical distance between the light source and the plane of reference for heights for the ENC data (see clause 2.5.7).

If it is required to encode the elevation of a light on a fixed structure, it must be done using the attribute *height*.

If it is required to encode the height above the water surface of a light on a floating structure, it must be done using the attribute *vertical length* on the relevant light feature (see clause 2.5.7).

[[sec_19.1.4]]
==== Times of exhibition and exhibition conditions (see S-4 -- B-473)

[[sec_19.1.4.1]]
===== Night lights

If it is required to encode a night light, it must be done using the attribute *exhibition condition of light* = _4_ (night light) on the light feature.

[[sec_19.1.4.2]]
===== Unwatched lights (see S-4 -- B-473.1)

This information should not be encoded, but unwatched (unmanned) lights, with no standby or emergency arrangements, may be encoded using attribute *status* = _17_ (unwatched).

[[sec_19.1.4.3]]
===== Occasional lights (see S-4 -- B-473.2)

If it is required to encode an occasional light, it must be done using attribute *status* = _2_ (occasional). If it is required to encode a private light that is not regularly exhibited, it must be done using *status* = _2,8_ (occasional, private).

[[sec_19.1.4.4]]
===== Daytime lights (see S-4 -- B-473.4)

If it is required to encode a light shown throughout 24 hours without change of character, it must be done using attribute *exhibition condition of light* = _1_ (light shown without change of character).

If it is required to encode a light having characteristics shown by day different from those shown at night, it must be done by encoding two light features sharing the same point spatial instance:

* one light feature with *exhibition condition of light* = _2_ (daytime light),
* one lightfeature with *exhibition condition of light* = _4_ (night light).

[[sec_19.1.4.5]]
===== Fog lights (see S-4 -- B-473.5)

If it is required to encode a light which is exhibited in fog or conditions of reduced visibility, it must be done using a light feature, with attributes *exhibition condition of light* = _3_ (fog light)and *status* = _2_ (occasional)_._

If it is required to encode a light having characteristics shown in fog that are different from those shown in conditions of normal visibility, it must be done by encoding two light features sharing the same point spatial instance:

* one light feature with *exhibition condition of light* = _3_ (fog light) and *status* = _2_ (occasional)
* one light feature with *exhibition condition of light* = _2_ (daytime light) or _4_ (night light) and the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6), sub-attribute *text* = _Character of the light changes in fog_.

Note the distinction between fog lights and fog detector lights, which are lights used to automatically determine conditions of visibility which warrant the turning on or off of a sound signal. Fog detector lights must be encoded, where required, using the feature *Light Fog Detector* (see clause 19.4).

[[sec_19.1.4.6]]
===== Manually-activated lights (see S-4 -- B-473.5)

If a light is radio activated, the attribute *signal generation* must be populated with value _5_ (radio activated). To encode the contact information for activation of the light, it must be done using the information type*Contact Details* (see clause24.1). The *Contact Details* must be associated to the light feature using the association *Additional Information*.

If a light is activated by calling into a manned station, the attribute *signal generation* must be populated with value _6_ (call activated). To encode the contact information for the manned station, it must be done using the information type*Contact Details*. The *Contact Details* must be associated to the light feature using the association *Additional Information*.

[[sec_19.1.5]]
==== Leading lights (see S-4 -- B-475.6)

If it is required to encode a leading light, it must be done using an appropriate light feature, with attribute:

*category of light*  = _4,12_ - front leading light

_4,13_ - rear leading light

_4,14_ - lower leading light

_4,15_ - upper leading light

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Even if, on the source, the leading lights are merged into a single symbol, a light feature must be created for each light. These lights must be placed in their true position; that is, where the source shows a single light with a legend such as __2F.

Bu__, further investigation must be done in order to determine the true position of each light, and its full attribution. Compilers should note that where this occurs on paper charts, the position of the light shown on the chart normally corresponds with the rear leading light.
* The leading line must be encoded using the method described in clause 15.1.

[[sec_19.1.6]]
==== Lighthouses (see S-4 -- B-457.3)

If it is required to encode a lighthouse, it must be done using a *Landmark* feature (see clause 7.2), with attributes *category of landmark* = _17_ (tower)and *function* = _33_ (light support)for towers, or using a *Building* feature (see clause 6.2), with the attribute *function* = __33__, for any other shapes.

If it is required to encode the attributes **elevation**, *height* and *vertical length* for a lighthouse, this must be done as described in clause 19.1.3.

If the lighthouse is permanently extinguished/unlit, this must be indicated by population of the attribute *status* = _4_ (not in use) for the *Landmark*/**Building**, and the lightfeature must be removed. Where a lighthouse is illuminated by flood lights, the additional value of *status* = _12_ (illuminated) must also be populated. For lights that are temporarily extinguished, see clause 31.2.2 -- paragraph 10(i).

|

| The pattern must be encoded using complex attribute **information**, sub-attribute **text**; for example _lights disposed in the shape of a triangle_. The number of lights must be encoded using complex attribute *multiplicity of features*
|===

[[sec_19.1.8]]
==== Light structures

Light features located in the water must have a structure feature, generally a beacon (for example**Lateral Beacon**, *Special Purpose/General Beacon*) or other fixed structure (for example*Offshore Platform*), or a buoy structure (for example**Lateral Buoy**, *Special Purpose/General Buoy*) for floating aids to navigation. When a light is located in the water with no indication on the source of the structure feature, regardless of the height of the light, a *Pile* feature of type surface or a *Special Purpose/General Beacon* feature should be encoded as the structure feature. This will ensure that a symbol will be shown on ECDIS systems when the light features are not displayed during daytime navigation.

The light portrayal rules for ECDIS result in the display of *Light All Around* features with Boolean attribute *major light* = _True_ using a 360 light sector. On land, if no aid to navigation structure object has been encoded at the position of these lights, the Mariner does not have a displayed centre point to take bearings to:


[[fig_19-1]]
.Omnidirectional light display in ECDIS
image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_1d999f3.jpg["",602,315]


Encoders are advised, therefore, that an aid to navigation structure object (for example **Special Purpose/General Beacon**, *Pile*) should be encoded as a light structure object for all *Light All Around* features on land encoded as major lights, where the nature of the structure object is unknown.

==== All around lights (see S-4 -- B-470)

If it is required to encode an all around light (excluding fog detector and air obstruction lights), it must be done using the feature *Light All Around*. This feature must be an equipment feature of a structure feature (see clause 18.2), which may be another light feature at the same position (if it exists and there is no structure feature available), using a *Structure/Equipment* feature association.

The IALA Maritime Buoyage Systemrules do not apply for most landfall lights and will apply to minor lights, but not to leading lights, some sector lights or major floating lights. In general, sector lights follow IALA convention when used for marking a channel.

Further guidance for encoding various types and characteristics of lights can be found in clauses 19.1.1 to 19.1.7.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* All sector lights, whether single sectored, multi-sectored or having sectors that are deliberately obscured or completely or partially obscured by obstructions, must be encoded, where required, using the feature *Light Sectored* (see clause 19.3); for encoding a directional sector or bearing, see clause 19.3.1.2.
* Fog detector and air obstruction lights must be encoded, where required, using the features *Light Fog Detector* and *Light Air Obstruction* (see clauses 19.4 and 19.5).
* If it is required to encode details of the lighting technology (for example neon), it must be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).

* If it is required to encode the purpose of a marine spotlight, it must be done using the complex attribute*information*.
* Lights on land encoded as major lights (Boolean attribute *major light* = _True_) must have a structure feature encoded (see clause19.1.8) in order for the position of the light to be clearly indicated in the ECDIS.
* The attribute *vertical datum* applies only to **height**; this value must only be encoded if it is different from the value of *vertical datum* encoded on the underlying Meta feature *Vertical Datum of Data* (see clause 3.10).
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the reference datum for the height of the light in tidal waters.
* The attribute *vertical length* only applies to lights attached to floating structures (see clause 2.5.7).
* The indication that a light is a "major" light through the population of the Boolean attribute *major light* with a _True_ value determines the way the light is displayed in ECDIS, and is not based on any legal or formal classification of the importance of lights. Generally, a major light may be considered to be a light intended for use at sea, usually with a range of 15 miles or more, and in outer approaches to harbours. However the determination of what is a major light may be based on a number of additional factors, including the number and characteristics of navigational (and non-navigational) lights in the geographical area, and specific navigational requirements for the area. Indication in a dataset that a light is a major light should be based only on the requirements for ECDIS display, at the discretion of the Producing Authority.
* Names of major lightsare very important. If a light has a name which is unrelated to any other encoded feature, the name must be populated using the complex attribute *feature name* (see clause 2.5.8) on at least the largest optimum display scale ENC data. If the name of a light is obviously that of the named feature on which the light stands, for example Saint Catherine's Point, the name of the light need not be repeated for the light.

==== Sectored lights (see S-4 -- B-475)

If it is required to encode a light that consists of one or more sectors, it must be done using the feature *Light Sectored*. This feature must be an equipment feature of a structure feature (see clause 18.1), which may be another light feature at the same position (if it exists and there is no structure feature available), using a *Structure/equipment* feature association.

The IALA Maritime Buoyage Systemrules do not apply for most landfall lights and will apply to minor lights, but not to leading lights, some sector lights or major floating lights. In general, sector lights follow IALA convention when used for marking a channel.

Further guidance for encoding various types and characteristics of lights can be found in clauses 9.1.1 to 9.1.7.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The complex attribute **sector characteristics**, sub-complex attribute *light sector* is used to populate each sector for the light, except for sectors in which there is no light exhibited. Where there is a different rhythm of light between sectors (for example, for complex lights), separate instances of *sector characteristics* must be populated.
* Population of the sub-complex attribute *sector limit* having sub-attributes *sector limit one* = _0_ and *sector limit two* = _360_ (that is, encoding an all around light as a sectored light) is prohibited.
* If a sector of a sectored light is intended to have a directional function, this must be encoded using the *light sector* complex sub-attribute *directional character*. If the light is intensified in this sector, *light sector* sub-attribute *light visibility* = _4_ (intensified) must be populated. The sub-complex attribute *sector limit* is optional for directional light sectors.
* The sub-attribute *sector line length* (see clause 27.158) may be used for critical light sectors to extend the sector line when the ECDIS display settings are set to display default sector lines. The intended usage of the ENC dataset must be considered when determining the usage of *sector line length* so as to avoid excessive screen clutter when default sector display is enabled; and consistent display of light sectors across the entire ENC portfolio should also be a consideration when determining the population of this attribute. Where populated, the value of *sector line length* must not exceed the value populated for the sub-attribute *value of nominal range* for the light sector.
* In some cases the area defined by the intersecting sectors of two discrete sector lights are used to indicate the existence of isolated and sometimes substantial dangers to navigation, the precise position of which may not be known. When default sectors are displayed in ECDIS, the extent and intent of these sectors may not be clearly defined to the Mariner. In order to more clearly indicate these areas, compilers should consider appropriate use of *sector line length* for the relevant sectors in the impacted area. Where it is considered important that the area of possible danger is defined, this should be done by encoding a *Caution Area* feature (see clause 16.10) covering the intersection area. Information relating to the definition of the area by sector lights and a précis of the danger should be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) for the *Caution Area*.
* The fairway defined by the succession of navigable areas in the white sectors of a series of *Light Sectored* features may be encoded using the feature *Fairway* (see clause 15.7).
* If there is additional information required to be encoded that is relevant to all sectors of the light, this must be done using the *information* (see clause 2.4.6). If the additional information is relevant to individual sectors of the light only (for example, for complex (oscillating) light sectors (see clause 19.3.1.3 below)), this must be encoded using the complex sub-attribute *sector information* for the sub-complex attribute *light sector*.
* If it is required to encode details of the lighting technology (for example neon), it must be done using the complex attribute *information*.

* The attribute *vertical datum* applies only to **height**; this value must only be encoded if it is different from the value of *vertical datum* encoded on the underlying Meta feature *Vertical Datum of Data* (see clause 3.10).
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the reference datum for the height of the light in tidal waters.
* Names of major lightsare very important. If a light has a name which is unrelated to any other encoded feature, the name must be populated using the complex attribute *feature name* (see clause 2.5.8) on at least the largest scale optimum display scale ENC data. If the name of a light is obviously that of the named feature on which the light stands, for example Saint Catherine's Point, the name of the light need not be repeated for the light.

===== Lights obscured by obstructions (see S-4 -- B-475.3)

[[fig_19-2]]
.Obscured light sectors
image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_7e764576.gif[Shape37,498,198]


If an encoded light is obscured in a part of the navigable area of a sector (see Figure 19-2 (A) above) beyond an offshore obstruction, it must be encoded using **Light Sectored**, with each of the sectors (a) -- (c) encoded using the complex attribute *light sector*. The partially obscured sector of (b) must have *light sector* with sub-attributes *light visibility* = _8_ (partially obscured) and sub-attribute *value of nominal range* set to the distance from the light to the obstruction. The sectors in which the light is visible from seaward ((a) and (c)) must be encoded as separate iterations of *light sector*.

If there is no navigable water between the light and the obstacle (see (e) in Figure 19-2 (B) above), the masked sector must not have an iteration of *light sector* encoded, unless a faint light is visible in the navigable part of the sector, which should be encoded using **light sector**, with sub-attribute *light visibility* = _3_ (faint). The sectors in which the light is visible from seaward ((d) and (f)) must be encoded as separate iterations of *sector characteristics*.

[[sec_19.3.1.2]]
===== Directional lights (see S-4 -- B-475.7-8)

Directional (or direction) lightsof several types are in use but all have in common a very narrow sector intended to mark a direction to be followed. The narrow sector may be flanked by:

* Unlit sectors or unintensified light.
* Sectors of different colour or character.

Some direction lights are so precise that a complete colour change at a sector boundary occurs over an angle of less than 1 minute (0∙02°). This corresponds to a lateral distance of just 1 metre at a viewing distance of 3.5 km. In addition the intensity may be maintained right to the edge of the beam, and does not reduce the further the observer is away from the axis.
A moiré effect mark (or variable arrow mark)is a short-range (normally up to 2 km) type of directional "light". Sodium lighting gives a yellow background to a screen (up to 3 m square) on which a vertical black line will be seen by an observer on the centreline, or variable arrow marks when course alteration is needed. The system can be used by day and night. It can also be used as a stop line (seen abeam) for vessels berthing along quays.

If it is required to encode a light sector having a directional function, it must be done using the feature *Light Sectored*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The indication that a particular light sector has a directional function is encoded by populating the complex attribute **sector characteristics**, sub-complex attribute *directional character*.
* The mandatory complex sub-attribute *orientation* must only be encoded to indicate the orientation, measured from seaward, of the leading line of the directional light sector when there is no *Recommended Track* or *Navigation Line* feature associated with the directional light. Where the directional sector has an associated *Recommended Track* and/or **Navigation Line**, *orientation* (*orientation value*) for the light sector must be populated with an empty (null) value.
* For a sector indicated as directional, the *light sector* complex sub-complex attribute *sector limit* is optional.
* For moiré effect lights, the Boolean sub-attribute *moiré effect* must be set to _True_.

* If it is required to encode the recommended track and/or navigation line associated with a directional light, it must be done using the methods described in clause 15.1.

[[sec_19.3.1.3]]
===== Oscillating light sectors

Evolving technology in the development of navigational lights has resulted in the installation of complex directional navigation lights with multiple sectors, colours and characteristics, some with oscillating sectors, in many areas where navigation is restricted. These lights may have up to 7 sectors, with the central sector being a very narrow, sometimes intensified, fixed white sector performing the directional function of the light. In the IALA A System, the sectors flanking this directional light may be alternating and oscillate increasingly from white to green (to starboard) and red (to port) with increasing deviation from the track defined by the directional light. These lights will normally be flanked by narrow sectors of fixed green (to starboard) and red (to port). Additionally, there may be outer sectors that are occulting green (to starboard) and red (to port) which oscillate with increasing period of eclipse to isophased or flashing with increasing deviation from the track defined by the directional light. For the IALA B System the colours are reversed. In some cases these complex lights may not conform to IALA. Each of the outer sectors may be very narrow.

If is required to encode an oscillating light sector, it should be done using a *Light Sectored* feature, with iterations of the complex attribute *sector characteristics* as follows: For light sectors in the IALA A system that are alternating and oscillate increasingly from white to green (to starboard) and red (to port) with increasing deviation from the track defined by the directional light:*sector characteristics***:** *light characteristic* = _28_ (Alternating); *colour* = _1,3_ (White, Red); **sector limit**; *sector* **information** (*text*) = __White phase decreases as bearing to light increases__**sector characteristics****:** *light characteristic* = _28_ (Alternating); *colour* = _1,4_ (White, Green); **sector limit**; *sector* **information** (*text*) = __White phase increases as bearing to light increases__For lights in the IALA B system that are alternating and oscillate increasingly from white to red (to starboard) and green (to port) with increasing deviation from the track defined by the directional light; transpose the colours red and green in the above encoding.

For lights in the IALA A system that are occulting green (to starboard) and red (to port) which oscillate with increasing period of eclipse to isophased or flashing with increasing deviation from the track defined by the directional light:*sector characteristics***:** *light characteristic* = _8_ (Occulting); *colour* = _3_ (Red); **sector limit**; *sector* **information** (*text*) = __Light phase decreases as bearing to light increases__**sector characteristics****:** *light characteristic* = _8_ (Occulting); *colour* = _4_ (Green); **sector limit**; *sector* **information** (*text*) = __Light phase increases as bearing to light increases__For lights in the IALA B system that are occulting red (to starboard) and green (to port) which oscillate with increasing period of eclipse to isophased or flashing with increasing deviation from the track defined by the directional light; transpose the colours red and green in the above encoding.

Oscillating lights which are not IALA should be encoded similar to the above. For instance, where a light contains white sectors that are occulting and oscillate with increasing period of eclipse to isophased or flashing with increasing deviation from the track defined by the directional light:For the sector to port of the track defined by the directional light:*sector characteristics***:** *light characteristic* = _8_ (Occulting); *colour* = _1_ (White); **sector limit**; *sector* **information** (*text*) = __Light phase decreases as bearing to light increases__For the sector to starboard of the track defined by the directional light:*sector characteristics***:** *light characteristic* = _8_ (Occulting); *colour* = _1_ (White); **sector limit**; *sector* **information** (*text*) = __Light phase increases as bearing to light increases__All other light sectors must be encoded using additional iterations of **sector characteristics**, with sub-attributes (including *light sector* or *directional character*) populated in accordance with the characteristics of the sector.

==== Fog detector lights (see S-4 -- B-477)

If it is required to encode a light used to automatically determine conditions of visibility which warrant the turning on or off of a sound signal, it must be done using the feature *Light Fog Detector*. This feature must be an equipment feature of a structure feature (see clause 18.1), if it exists, using a *Structure/Equipment* feature association.

Further guidance for encoding various types and characteristics of lights can be found in clauses 19.1.1 to 19.1.7.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode details of the lighting technology (for instance neon), it must be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).

* The attribute *vertical datum* applies only to **height**; this value must only be encoded if it is different from the value of *vertical datum* encoded on the underlying Meta feature *Vertical Datum of Data* (see clause 3.10).
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the reference datum for the height of the light in tidal waters.
* The attribute *vertical length* only applies to lights attached to floating structures (see clause 2.5.7).

==== Lateral buoys (see S-4 -- B-461.3 and B-467)

Lateral buoysare generally used for well-defined channels, in conjunction with a direction of buoyage. They indicate the port and starboard sides of the route to be followed.

To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System (see clause 18.3.1.1), port handbuoys are usually can shaped, but may be another shape (except conical or spherical). Other shaped buoys have a can topmark. The colour of port hand buoys, topmarks and lights (if fitted) will be red in IALA region A and green in IALA region B.

To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System, starboard hand buoys are usually conical shaped, but may be another shape (except can or spherical). Other shaped buoys have a conical topmark. The colour of starboard hand buoys, topmarks and lights (if fitted) will be green in IALA region A and red in IALA region B.

A preferred channel markis a modified lateral mark, with horizontal colour bands. The shape and predominant colour indicates which side is the preferred channel, the other colour indicates the secondary channel. If fitted, the light is Fl(2+1), the colour indicating the preferred channel.

If it is required to encode a buoy having the function of a lateral mark, it must be done using the feature *Lateral Buoy*.

Remarks:

* If it is required to encode a buoy or topmark that has more than one colour, the attributes *colour* and *colour pattern* must be encoded, according to the rules laid out in clause 2.4.10.
* If it is required to encode the total vertical length, including the topmark and any equipment features (for example light), of the buoy above the water level, it must be done using the attribute *vertical length*.

==== Cardinal buoys (see S-4 -- B-461.3 and B-467)

Cardinal marksare used in conjunction with the compass to indicate where a Mariner may find best navigable water, taking their name from the quadrant in which they are placed in relation to the point marked. The Mariner should pass N of a North mark, E of an East mark, etc. The shape of cardinal buoys is not significant (although they are usually pillar or spar). To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System (see clause 18.3.1.1), the body has black and yellow bands, configured with black reflecting the points of the topmark cones (for example black above yellow for north). Black double-cone topmarks are an important feature of cardinal marks and are carried wherever practicable. The points are up for a north mark, down for a south mark, apart for an east mark and together for a west mark. Lights (if fitted) are white Q or VQ, uninterrupted for the north, 3 flashes for east, 6 flashes + LFl for south and 9 flashes for west (resembling an analogue clock).

If it is required to encode a buoy having the function of a cardinal mark, it must be done using the feature *Cardinal Buoy*.

* If it is required to encode a buoy or topmark that has more than one colour, the attributes *colour* and *colour pattern* must be encoded, according to the rules laid out in clause 2.4.10.
* If it is required to encode the total vertical length, including the topmark and any equipment features (for example light), of the buoy above the water level, it must be done using the attribute *vertical length*.

==== Safe water buoys (see S-4 -- B-461.3 and B-467)

Safe water marksare used to indicate there is safe water all around the mark. It may be used as a centre-line, mid-channel or landfall buoy, or to mark the best point of passage under a bridge.

To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System (see clause 18.3.1.1), the shape of a safe water buoy is spherical, pillar or spar. The body of the mark has red and white vertical stripes. If the shape of the buoy is not spherical a red spherical topmark is carried wherever practicable. The light (if fitted) is white Oc, Iso, LFl or Mo(A) with a period of 10s.

If it is required to encode a buoy having the function of a safe water mark, it must be done using the feature *Safe Water Buoy*.

Remarks:

* If it is required to encode a buoy or topmark that has more than one colour, the attributes *colour* and *colour pattern* must be encoded, according to the rules laid out in clause 2.4.10.
* If it is required to encode the total vertical length, including the topmark and any equipment features (for example light), of the buoy above the water level, it must be done using the attribute *vertical length*.

[underline]#INT 1 Reference:# Q 50-62, 130.6

[[sec_20.5.1]]
==== Special purpose/general buoys (see S-4 -- B-461.3 and B-467)

Special marksare used to indicate to the Mariner a special area or feature, the nature of which is usually apparent from the ENC, paper chart or associated publication. Special marks may also be used to mark a channel within a channel (for example a Deep Water route), using yellow buoys of the appropriate lateral shape, or yellow spherical buoys to mark the centreline. A special buoy may be any shape but must not conflict with lateral or safe water marks (for example an outfall buoy on the port-side of a channel could be can but should not be conical). To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System (see clause 18.3.1.1), the body of the buoy is yellow. The topmark (if fitted) is a yellow diagonal 'X' (St Andrew's cross). Lights (if fitted) are yellow and of any rhythm except those used for cardinal, isolated danger and safe water marks.

If it is required to encode a buoy having the function of a special purpose mark, or a buoy whose appearance or purpose is inadequately known, it must be done using the feature *Special Purpose/General Buoy*.

In the following Table, a blank indicates that the encoder may choose a relevant value for the attribute. The Table contains the most common examples of coding; other coding combinations are possible for *Special Purpose/General Buoy* features.

* If it is required to encode the total vertical length, including the topmark and any equipment features (for example light), of the buoy above the water level, it must be done using the attribute *vertical length*.
* If a special purpose buoy does not conform to the system of navigational marks defined by *Navigational System of Marks* (see clause 3.6), the attribute *marks navigational -- system of* on the *Special Purpose/General Buoy* should be populated as _9_ (no system).
* Fish havens (sometimes referred to as subsurface Fish Aggregating Devices (FAD)) and subsurface Ocean Data Acquisition System (ODAS) equipment must be encoded, where required, using an *Obstruction* feature (see clause 13.6).
* A buoy deployed as an emergency measure to mark a newly identified danger, such as a wreck, must be encoded using the feature *Emergency Wreck Marking Buoy* (see clause 20.6). A special purpose buoy intended to permanently mark a wreck as a danger must be encoded, where required, as a *Special Purpose/General Buoy* feature, with attribute *category of special purpose mark* = _60_ (wreck mark).

==== Emergency wreck marking buoys (see S-4 -- B-461.3 and B-467)

Emergency wreck marking buoysare used to mark new wrecks until a permanent form of marking has been established and the wreck itself has been promulgated by Notice to Mariners, or removed.

To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System (see clause 18.3.1.1), the shape of an emergency wreck marking buoy is pillar or spar. The body of the mark has blue and yellow vertical stripes. The topmark (if fitted) is a standing/upright yellow '+' (St. George's cross). Lights (if fitted) are Al.

Oc.

BuY.3s.

If it is required to encode a buoy having the function of an emergency wreck mark, it must be done using the feature *Emergency Wreck Marking Buoy*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode a buoy or topmark that has more than one colour, the attributes *colour* and *colour pattern* must be encoded, according to the rules laid out in clause 2.4.10.
* If it is required to encode the total vertical length, including the topmark and any equipment features (for example light), of the buoy above the water level, it must be done using the attribute *vertical length*.
* An IALA compliant emergency wreck marking buoy topmark should be populated using the complex attribute **topmark**, with sub-attributes *topmark shape* = _8_ (upright cross) and *colour* = _6_ (yellow).
* An IALA compliant emergency wreck marking buoy should also have the following associated equipment features:

** A *Light All Around* feature (see clause 19.2), with attributes *colour* = _5,6_ (blue, yellow), *light characteristic* = _17_ (occulting alternating), *signal group* = _(1)_ and *signal period* = _3_. The complex attribute **signal sequence**, sub-attributes *signal duration* and **signal status**, should be populated equivalent to __(___00.50)+01.00+(00.50)+01.00_ (bracketed values corresponding to periods of eclipse and non-bracketed values corresponding to periods of light);and the attribute *value of nominal range* should be populated as _4_.
** A *Radar Transponder Beacon* feature (see clause 21.5), with attributes *category of radar transponder beacon* = _2_ (racon, radar transponder beacon) and *signal group* = _(D)_.

==== Installation buoys (see S-4 -- B-445.4)

Although the oil and gas from some fields are sent ashore by submarine pipeline, a variety of mooring systems have been developed for use in deep water and in the vicinity of certain ports, to allow the loading of large vessels and the permanent mooring of floating storage vessels or units. These offshore systems include large mooring buoys, designed for mooring vessels up to 500,000 tonnes, and platforms on structures fixed at their lower ends to the seafloor. They allow a vessel to moor forward or aft to them, and to swing to the wind or stream, and are termed installation buoys.

If it is required to encode an installation buoy, it must be done using the feature *Installation Buoy*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode a buoy that has more than one colour, the attributes *colour* and *colour pattern* must be encoded, according to the rules laid out in clause 2.4.10.

==== Lateral Beacons (see S-4 -- B-461.3 and B-467)

Lateral beaconsare generally used for well defined channels, in conjunction with a direction of buoyage. They indicate the port and starboard sides of the route to be followed.

To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System (see clause 18.3.1.1), port handbeacons have a can shaped topmark. The colour of port hand beacons, topmarks and lights (if fitted) will be red in IALA region A and green in IALA region B.

To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System, starboard hand beacons have a conical shaped topmark. The colour of starboard hand beacons, topmarks and lights (if fitted) will be green in IALA region A and red in IALA region B.

A preferred channel beaconis a modified lateral beacon, with horizontal colour bands. The predominant colour indicates which side is the preferred channel, the other colour indicates the secondary channel. If fitted, the light is Fl(2+1), the colour indicating the preferred channel.

If it is required to encode a beacon having the function of a lateral mark, it must be done using the feature *Lateral Beacon*.

Remarks:

* If it is required to encode a beacon or topmark that has more than one colour, the attributes *colour* and *colour pattern* must be encoded, according to the rules laid out in clause 2.4.10.
* For guidance on the encoding of the attributes **elevation**, *height* and *vertical length* see clause 2.5.7. *elevation* applies only to beacons on land. Values populated for *height* and *vertical length* must include the topmark and any equipment features.
* If it is required to encode a cairn that bears the colour(s) specified by a navigational system of marks, it must be done using a beacon feature.

==== Cardinal beacons (see S-4 -- B-461.3 and B-467)

Cardinal marksare used in conjunction with the compass to indicate where a Mariner may find best navigable water, taking their name from the quadrant in which they are placed in relation to the point marked. The Mariner should pass N of a North mark, E of an East mark, etc. To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System (see clause 18.3.1.1), the body of the beacon has black and yellow bands, configured with black reflecting the points of the topmark cones (for example black above yellow for north). Black double-cone topmarks are an important feature of cardinal marks and are carried wherever practicable. The points are up for a north mark, down for a south mark, apart for an east mark and together for a west mark. Lights (if fitted) are white Q or VQ, uninterrupted for the north, 3 flashes for east, 6 flashes + LFl for south and 9 flashes for west (resembling an analogue clock).

If it is required to encode a beacon having the function of a cardinal mark, it must be done using the feature *Cardinal Beacon*.

==== Isolated danger beacons (see S-4 -- B-461.3 and B-467)

Isolated danger beaconsare placed on isolated dangers of limited extent with navigable water all around them. To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System (see clause 18.3.1.1), the body of an isolated danger beacon is black, with one or more red bands. Black double-sphere topmarks are an important feature of isolated danger beacons and carried wherever practicable. The light (if fitted) is white Fl(2).

If it is required to encode a beacon having the function of an isolated danger mark, it must be done using the feature *Isolated Danger Beacon*.

.IALA isolated danger beacons -- Characteristics
image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_177836fa.png["",549,263]

Remarks:

* If it is required to encode a beacon or topmark that has more than one colour, the attributes *colour* and *colour pattern* must be encoded, according to the rules laid out in clause 2.4.10.
* For guidance on the encoding of the attributes **elevation**, *height* and *vertical length* see clause 2.5.7. *elevation* applies only to beacons on land. Values populated for *height* and *vertical length* must include the topmark and any equipment features.
* If it is required to encode a cairn that bears the colour(s) specified by a navigational system of marks, it must be done using a beacon feature.

==== Safe water beacons (see S-4 -- B-461.3 and B-467)

Safe water marksare used to indicate there is safe water all around the mark. It may be used as a centre-line, mid-channel or landfall beacon, or to mark the best point of passage under a bridge. To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System (see clause 18.3.1.1), the body of the mark has red and white vertical stripes. A red spherical topmark is an important feature and carried wherever practicable. The light (if fitted) is white Oc, Iso, LFl or Mo(A) with a period of 10s.

If it is required to encode a beacon having the function of a safe water mark, it must be done using the feature *Safe Water Beacon*.

==== Special purpose/general beacons (see S-4 -- B-461.3 and B-467)

Special beaconsare used to indicate to the Mariner a special area or feature, the nature of which is usually apparent from the chart or associated publication. To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System (see clause 18.3.1.1), the body of the beacon is yellow. The topmark (if fitted) is a yellow diagonal 'X' (St Andrew's cross). Lights (if fitted) are yellow and of any rhythm except those used for cardinal, isolated danger and safe water marks.

If it is required to encode a beacon having the function of a special purpose mark, or a beacon whose appearance or purpose is inadequately known, it must be done using the feature *Special Purpose/General Beacon*.

In the following Table, a blank indicates that the encoder may choose a relevant value for the attribute. The Table contains the most common examples of coding; other coding combinations are possible.

__**Table 20-2 -- IALA special purpose beacons -- Common types**__

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Non-beacon structures (for example chimneys, masts, towers) that are also used to serve the purpose of a special purpose beacon must be encoded, where required, using the feature *Landmark* (see clause 7.2).
* If it is required to encode a beacon or topmark that has more than one colour, the attributes *colour* and *colour pattern* must be encoded, according to the rules laid out in clause 2.4.10.
* For guidance on the encoding of the attributes **elevation**, *height* and *vertical length* see clause 2.5.7. *elevation* applies only to beacons on land. Values populated for *height* and *vertical length* must include the topmark and any equipment features.
* If a special purpose beacon does not conform to the system of navigational marks defined by *Navigational System of Marks* (see clause 3.6), the attribute *marks navigational -- system of* on the *Special Purpose/General Beacon* should be populated as _9_ (no system).
* If it is required to encode a cairn that bears the colour(s) specified by a navigational system of marks, it must be done using a beacon feature.

[[sec_20.13.2]]
==== Signs and notice boards

If it is required to encode a fixed or floating sign or notice board, it must be done using a *Special Purpose/General Beacon* feature or *Special Purpose/General Buoy* feature (see clause 20.5), with attribute *category of special purpose mark* = _18_ (notice mark), or using the feature *Daymark* (see clause 20.14).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode a sign or notice board that has more than one colour, the attributes *colour* and *colour pattern* must be used, according to the rules laid out in clause 2.4.10.
* If it is required to encode any text shown on a notice board or sign, it must be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).
* If it is required to encode the shape and colour of a notice board, it must be done by encoding the board as a *Daymark* feature.

9+h| IHO Definition: *DAYMARK*. The identifying characteristics of an aid to navigation which serve to facilitate its recognition against a daylight viewing background. On those structures that do not by themselves present an adequate viewing area to be seen at the required distance, the aid is made more visible by affixing a daymark to the structure. A daymark so affixed has a distinctive colour and shape depending on the purpose of the aid. (IHO Dictionary -- S-32, Edition 5). |

==== Daymarks (see S-4 -- B-455.9)

If it is required to encode a daymark, it must be done using the feature *Daymark*.

The term "daymark"may also simply refer to any unlit aid to navigation, particularly for leading marks. In North America, the term "daybeacon"is used for an unlit beacon.

In the following Table, a blank indicates that the encoder may choose a relevant value for the attribute. The Table contains the most common examples of coding; other coding combinations are possible.

* If it is required to encode an aid to navigation that may be considered to be a topmark but has multiple colours that are considered important for navigation, this should be done using *Daymark*.
* If it is required to encode a daymark that has more than one colour, the attributes *colour* and *colour pattern* must be encoded, according to the rules laid out in clause 2.4.10. If the colour pattern for the daymark is complex, it is strongly recommended that an image of the daymark is included, using the attribute *pictorial representation*.

==== Lights vessels (see S-4 -- B-474.1-3)

Major floating lightsare generally classed as those with a nominal range in excess of 10 nautical miles. Special circumstances, for example an isolated location, may mean that a floating light of lower range is given this status. The structure on which the light is fixed will be a light vessel, a major light float or a LANBY (Large Automatic Navigational Buoy, which is a type of superbuoy).

If it is required to encode a light vessel, it must be done using the feature *Light Vessel*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode a light vessel that has more than one colour, the attributes *colour* and *colour pattern* must be encoded, according to the rules laid out in clause 2.4.10.

==== Fog signals (see S-4 -- B-451-454)

The term "fog signal" refers to the sound emitted, not the apparatus. Fog signals are short range aids to navigation, principally used as hazard warnings. For various reasons they are unreliable as indicators of position. Their importance relative to other aids to navigation has declined but they are still considered useful for the safe navigation of vessels with very limited (or non-functioning) electronic equipment. A fog signal should be shown on ENCs at an optimum display scale on which vessels may navigate within range.

The positionfrom which a fog signal is emitted is usually on a buoy, or close enough to a light to be treated as sounded from the same position as the light.

If it is required to encode a fog signal, it must be done using the feature *Fog Signal*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The characteristic rhythm of fog signals (other than those actuated by waves, which are irregular) may be more important than their type when Mariners are attempting to identify them. The number of sound emissions (for example blasts, strokes) and the period must therefore be encoded, where known, using the attributes **signal group**, *signal period* and *signal sequence*.
* Where required, the attribute *signal frequency* must be quoted in Hertz, for example a signal frequency of 950 MHz must be encoded as _950000000_.
* If the fog signal is radio activated, the attribute *signal generation* must be populated with value _5_ (radio activated). To encode the contact information for activation of the signal, it must be done using the information type*Contact Details* (see clause24.1). The *Contact Details* must be associated to the *Fog Signal* feature using the association *Additional Information*.
* If the fog signal is activated by calling into a manned station, the attribute *signal generation* must be populated with value _6_ (call activated). To encode the contact information for the manned station, it must be done using the information type*Contact Details*. The *Contact Details* must be associated to the *Fog Signal* feature using the association *Additional Information*.

=== Automatic Identification System (AIS) aids to navigation (see S-4 -- B-480-484)

AIS signals used as an aid to navigation may:

It is not required to encode AIS information on ENCs, as ENCs are intended to be used in conjunction with ECDIS as part of an Integrated Navigation System (INS), in which AIS targets are displayed when in range. However, Producing Authorities may wish to indicate the presence of a physical or virtual AIS aid to navigation to aid in the route planning process or for use in ECS or other navigation systems.

[[sec_21.4.1]]
==== Radio stations (see S-4 -- B-480-484)

Transmissions from radio stations may provide Mariners with a line of position. Most radio position fixing systems require Radio Direction Finding (RDF) equipment to determine the bearing of the transmitting device; such equipment is generally no longer fitted on vessels. The exception is "emergency use only" VHF-based direction finding services (which do not use RDF equipment). Consequently, the following radio position-fixing stations are now obsolete and there is no longer any value in encoding them on ENCs:

* Circular (non-directional) (RC), directional (RD) and rotating pattern (RW) marine radiobeacons;
* Consol beacons (Consol);
* Aeronautical radiobeacons (Aero RC);
* Radio direction-finding stations (except VHF-based emergency stations) (RG);
* Coast Radio Stations providing 'QTG' service (R).
The feature "radio station" is used to encode the point of transmission of the signal.

If it is required to encode a radio station, it must be done using the feature *Radio Station*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The *Radio Station* must only be used to encode the technical equipment itself, independent of the building or structure in which it is installed. If it is required to encode the building or structure (for example mast, tower, radar dome), it must be done using an appropriate feature (for example **Building**, *Landmark*). There is no requirement to establish a Structure/Equipment association between the *Radio Station* feature and the structure in which it is installed.
* Further information (for example transmission characteristic) may be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).
* Each VHF-channel should be indicated, using the attribute *communication channel* (see clause 27.77). Alternately, if the same VHF-channel(s) apply to multiple features in the dataset, this should be indicated through an associated instance of the information type **Contact Details**, attribute *communication channel* (see clause 24.1).
* If it is required to encode a DGPS station, it must be done using **Radio Station**, with attribute *category of radio station* = _10_ (Differential GNSS).
* Where required, the complex attribute **frequency pair**, sub-attributes *frequency shore station receives* and **frequency shore station transmits**, must be quoted in Hertz, for example a signal frequency of 950 MHz must be encoded as _950000000_.

[[sec_21.4.2]]
==== Radio direction-finding stations (see S-4 -- B-483)

If it is required to encode a radio direction-finding station, it must be done using a *Radio Station*feature, with attribute *category of radio station* = _5_ (radio direction-finding station). The identification signal may be encoded using the attribute *call sign*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Direction--finding is now only provided as an emergency service by VHF.

==== Radar beacons (see S-4 -- B-486)

Radar beacons are transmitters operating in the marine radar frequency band. The signals produce a characteristic line on a vessel's radar display enabling the Mariner to determine their position with greater certainty than would be possible by means of a normal radar display alone.

If it is required to encode a radar beacon, it must be done using the feature *Radar Transponder Beacon*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The *Radar Transponder Beacon* must only be used to encode the technical equipment itself, independent of the building or structure in which it is installed. If it is required to encode the building or structure (for example mast, tower, radar dome), it must be done using an appropriate feature (for example**Building**, *Landmark*).
* The attribute *signal group* is used to encode Morse identification letter(s) for the radar beacon, where known.
* Leading raconsare established such that, when their bearing lines are coincident on a vessel's radar display, the bearing serves to indicate the track to be followed. If it is required to encode the bearing line and the recommended track for leading racons, it must be done as described in clause 15.1. Where the bearing line coincides with a leading line defined by lights or other visual features making up a range system, navigation lines and recommended tracks must not be duplicated. The features making up the range system should be associated with a feature *Range System* (see clause 15.6) using the association *Range System Aggregation* (see clause 25.13). NOTE: All features comprising a range system must have the same value populated for the attribute *scale minimum* (see clause2.5.9).
* If, for some reason, the radar transponder beacon signal is obscured between certain bearings, this information should be encoded using the complex attribute *sector limit* to encode the "visible" sector, as for lights (see clause 19.3.1.1).
* The sweep period may be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).

==== Pilot boarding places (see S-4 -- B-491.1-2)

For a pilot boarding place, the pilot vessel may either cruise in the area or come out on request. Off some large ports pilots on outgoing ships may be disembarked at a different location. Pilots may board from a helicopter; it is then less important for a ship to reach the exact position of the boarding place but an approximate position should still be encoded. Some pilot stations are used solely for long-distance (deep-sea) pilots. Pilots may be in constant attendance, in regular attendance at certain limited times, or available by previous arrangement only. The primary purpose of encoded pilotage information is to show the position of the facility. Because of the many variations in the service provided, the main source of information on pilotage must be in an associated publication or product.

If it is required to encode a pilot boarding place, it must be done using the feature *Pilot Boarding Place*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode the ship to shore or shore to ship contact information, this should be done using the attribute *communication channel*. Alternately, if the same VHF-channel(s) apply to multiple features in the dataset, this should be indicated through an associated instance of the information type **Contact Details**, attribute *communication channel* (see clause 24.1).
* If it is required to encode the area in which pilotage regulations apply, it should be done using the feature *Pilotage District* (see clause 16.26). The relationship between the pilotage district and any associated pilot boarding places should be encoded using the feature association *Pilotage District Association* (see clause 25.11).

[[sec_22.1.2]]
==== Pilot stations ashore (see S-4 -- B-491.4)

If it is required to encode a pilot station ashore, it must be done using a *Building* or *Landmark* feature, with attribute *function* = _11_ (pilot office) or _12_ (pilot lookout).

==== Coast Guard stations (see S-4 -- B-492)

The organisation of coast-watching and rescue services differs from country to country. For charting purposes it is assumed that two distinct functions can be recognised, even though they may be parts of the same organisation co-ordinating and effecting life saving and performing other services. Coast Guard stations are stations at which a watch is kept either continuously, or at certain times only. They are sited so as to have a commanding view, are often associated with signal stations, and are visually prominent. They are also referred to as watch-keeping stations.

Coast Guard stationsare located along the coasts of most maritime nations. Their primary purpose in former days was to enforce customs regulations, observe the movements of ships and to watch for signs of distress at sea. These functions are largely superseded by modern telecommunications and Search & Rescue (SAR) arrangements, coordinated by regional Maritime Rescue and Coordination Centres (MRCC).

If it is required to encode a Coast Guard station, it must be done using the feature *Coast Guard Station*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Many modern Coast Guard services no longer maintain visual watch from fixed stations. However, because stations were usually situated so as to have a commanding view and may therefore be visually prominent and make good fixing marks, the buildings may still be encoded as *Building* or *Landmark*.
* The *Coast Guard Station* must only be used to describe the function of the Coast Guard station, independent of the building or structure itself. If it is required to encode the building or structure in which the Coast Guard station operates, it must be done using an appropriate feature (for example **Building**,*Landmark*).
* Maritime Rescue and Coordination Centres (MRCC) are part of a constantly manned communications watch system. If it is required to encode a MRCC, it should be done using **Coast Guard Station**, with the Boolean attribute *is MRCC* = _True_. The name of the station may be populated using the complex attribute *feature name* (sub-attribute *name*), for example _MRCC Swansea_.
* Each VHF-channel should be indicated, using the attribute *communication channel* (see clause 27.77). Alternately, if the same VHF-channel(s) apply to multiple features in the dataset, this should be indicated through an associated instance of the information type **Contact Details**, attribute *communication channel* (see clause 24.1).

They are encoded on the largest optimum display scale ENC data not only for their main role of signalling information and instructions but also as a form of landmark. The signals generally exhibit lights by day and night but may display shapes or flags by day.

==== Traffic signal stations (see S-4 -- B-494-5)

Signal stationscommunicating visually have declined in importance. They are encoded on the largest optimum display scale ENC data not only for their main role of signalling information and instructions but also as a form of landmark. The signals generally exhibit lights by day and night but may display shapes or flags by day.

The nature of traffic signals varies from country to country and even from port to port. For charting purposes traffic signals can be considered to include, for instance:

* Port entry and departure signals;
* Lock, docking and berthing signals;
* Bridge signals;
* International traffic signals.
If it is required to encode a traffic signal station, it must be done using the feature *Signal Station Traffic*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode a bridge light marking the centre of a navigable span, it must be done using a light feature (see Section 19).
* The *Signal Station Traffic* must only be used to describe the function of the signal station, independent of the building or structure itself. If it is required to encode the building or structure housing the service, it must be done using an appropriate feature (for example **Building**, *Landmark*).
* Each VHF-channel should be indicated, using the attribute *communication channel* (see clause 27.77). Alternately, if the same VHF-channel(s) apply to multiple features in the dataset, this should be indicated through an associated instance of the information type **Contact Details**, attribute *communication channel* (see clause 24.1).

==== Rescue station (see S-4 -- B-490 and B-493)

The organisation of coast-watching and rescue services differs from country to country. For charting purposes it is assumed that these two distinct functions can be recognised individually, even though they may be parts of the same organisation co-ordinating and effecting life saving and performing other services.

Rescue stations are the places at which life saving equipment is held, especially lifeboats (usually in relatively sheltered positions, near sea level). Rescue stations are not necessarily visually prominent. The range of equipment used in rescue is wide, for example search and rescue helicopters; fast, long-distance lifeboats; inflatable inshore lifeboats.

If it is required to encode a rescue station, it must be done using the feature *Rescue Station*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The *Rescue Station* must only be used to describe the function of the rescue station, independent of the building or structure itself. If it is required to encode the building or structure housing the service, it must be done using an appropriate feature (for example **Building**, *Landmark*).
* If it is required to encode a refuge beacon, it must be done using a *Special Purpose/General Beacon* feature, with attribute *category of special purpose mark* = _44_ (refuge beacon), not by using *Rescue Station*.
* Each VHF-channel should be indicated, using the attribute *communication channel* (see clause 27.77). Alternately, if the same VHF-channel(s) apply to multiple features in the dataset, this should be indicated through an associated instance of the information type **Contact Details**, attribute *communication channel* (see clause 24.1).

If it is required to encode a harbour facility, it must be done using the feature *Harbour Facility*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Fishing harbours or portsare equipped to provide for the particular needs of fishing boats. Boat harbours and marinasare areas of sheltered water, generally within harbours or ports, set aside for the use of small craft, usually with moorings, buoys, and, in the case of marinas, berthing facilities.
* Depending on the navigational purpose, harbour facilities are defined by: an area including docks, basins, infrastructure such as buildings, and dockside equipment; or a point.
* If it is required to encode a terminal with facilities to load/unload or store shipping containers, this should be done using *Harbour Facility* with attribute *category of harbour facility* = _10_ (container terminal).
* If it is required to encode a covered structure into which ships can go, this must be done using the feature *Structure Over Navigable Water* (see clause 8.7). These structures may be part of the larger harbour facility, which should be encoded as *Harbour Facility*.
* Each VHF-channel should be indicated using the attribute *communication channel* (see clause 27.77). Alternately, if the same VHF-channel(s) apply to multiple features in the dataset, this should be indicated through an associated instance of the information type **Contact Details**, attribute *communication channel* (see clause24.1).
* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.

==== Text placement

If it is required to place text on an ENC to improve clarity and readability of display, it must be done using the cartographic feature *Text Placement*. In navigationally relevant areas such as shipping channels and dredged areas, where default ECDIS text positioning may cover other features, Data Producers should consider using *Text Placement*. The *Text Placement* feature must be associated with the relevant geo feature using the composition *Text Association* (see clause 25.17).

NOTE: Where an associated instance of *Text Placement* has not been related to a feature having the attribute *name* and/or the attributes associated with the characteristics of a feature populated, the text will be positioned in the ECDIS display in accordance with the default position for text strings defined in the Portrayal Catalogue.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The *Text Placement* cartographic feature is used by the ECDIS to optionally position text in ECDIS, which has been populated using an attribute(s) for the associated feature. The attribute(s) is identified by populating the mandatory attribute *text type*.
* Where two instances of *text type* are populated for a *Text Placement* instance, the feature name and characteristics as derived from the target feature attribution will be vertically aligned in the ECDIS display in accordance with the defined text offset bearing and distance. If it is required to position the feature name and the feature characteristics independently, this must be done by associating two instances of **Text Placement**, one having *text type* = _1_ (name) and the other having *text type* = _2_ (feature characteristic), to the target feature. Note, however, that independent vertical or horizontal alignment of both the name and the characteristic of a feature is not recommended, as the text will overlap as the Mariner zooms to smaller scales than the optimum display scale for the data.
* The attributes *text offset bearing* and *text offset distance* define the bearing (related to true north) and distance of the anchor point of the text, in millimetres in the ECDIS display, to be displayed from the associated feature. The values populated for these attributes must be determined based on the desired position of the text at the optimum display scale of the ENC data. Note that the attribute *text offset bearing* does not rotate the text itself, but determines the alignment of the anchor point (or justification) for the text location (horizontal (left, centred or right) and vertical (bottom, centre or top)) based on the encoded bearing. Displayed text will always appear horizontal regardless of the display mode set by the mariner (north-up or course-up), unless the Boolean attribute *text rotation* is set to _True_.
* The Boolean attribute **text rotation**, when populated as __True__, will rotate the text on the ECDIS display to align along the bearing populated for the attribute *text offset bearing*.
* Data Producers are advised to determine the best positioning for text at the optimum display scale for the data; and based on "north-up" ECDIS display. While **text offset bearing**, *text offset distance* and *text rotation* will position the text at the same location relative to the associated feature at all Mariner's Selected Viewing Scales, Data Producers are advised that, as the Mariner zooms out to smaller viewing scales, text may unintentionally cover other charted detail. Therefore, as an alternative, Data Producers may experiment with positioning the text so that it clears the majority of other charted features at the smallest scale at which the text is intended to be displayed, and populating the attribute *scale minimum* accordingly (see bullet below). Data Producers are also advised that optimum results may not be achieved when the Mariner has set the display setting for the ECDIS to screen rotations other than "north-up". Encoders should also consider the positioning of the name of a feature where the name is encoded in multiple languages, as the name displayed may be of varying character length based on the Mariner's language settings (see clause 2.5.8).
* The attribute *scale minimum* may be used to determine a scale at which the text string is no longer visible in the ECDIS when scale minimum functionality is enabled. Where populated, the value for *scale minimum* on *Text Placement* must not be set to a smaller scale value than the value populated for the associated feature.
* S-101 portrayal for *Text Placement* has been developed to take into account the name of a light support structure feature where included in the association *Structure/Equipment* as follows:

** Where *Text Placement* containing attribute *text type* = _1_ (name) is associated to the equipment feature and the name has been encoded only on the structure feature, the *Text Placement* inherits the name from the structure.
** Where *Text Placement* containing attribute *text type* = _1_ (name) is associated to the equipment feature and the name has been encoded on the equipment feature, the *Text Placement* takes the name from the equipment feature. If a name has also been included on the structure feature, this will not be considered in this case, however a separate *Text Placement* associated to the structure may be encoded to place the name of the structure feature at a desired position, if required.
** Where *Text Placement* containing attribute *text type* = _2_ (feature characteristic) is associated to the equipment feature, the characteristics of the structure feature will not be considered.
* *Text Placement* should normally be associated with features of type point, but may be used for features of type curve and surface.

* The complex attribute **time intervals by day of week**, sub-attribute *day of week is range* indicates whether an instance of *time intervals by day of week* encodes a range of days or discrete days. The day(s) or day range(s) are encoded using sub-attribute *day of week*. Where *day of week is range* is populated as __True__, there must be exactly two instances of the attribute *day of week*. If *day of week* is not populated, this indicates that the same schedule applies every day (Monday through Sunday). Multiple ranges or mixing range with discrete days(s) is not allowed (if this is required another instance of *time intervals by day of week* must be encoded). See clause 2.4.9.
* Overlapping intervals bound to the same feature using the association *Additional Information* are not permitted.

==== Nautical information

If it is required to encode identical information associated with multiple geo features which cannot be encoded using the descriptive attributes on those features, it should be done using the information type*Nautical Information*. Each instance of *Nautical Information* must be associated to the feature(s) to which the information applies using the association *Additional Information* (see clause 25.1).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Within a dataset, individual instances of information associated with a geo feature which cannot be encoded using the descriptive attributes on the feature should be encoded using the attributes *information* or *pictorial representation* on the feature itself, not using *Nautical Information*. However where this information is shared between features contained in a single dataset, or included in multiple datasets within the ENC portfolio, *Nautical Information* may be used.
* *Nautical Information* must not be used to include a reference to a picture file (attribute *pictorial representation*) to a feature that does not itself include *pictorial representation* as an allowable attribute.
* The complex attributes *fixed date range* and **periodic date range**, when populated for **Nautical Information**, apply only to *Nautical* **Information** and not to any feature that it may be associated with.

[[sec_24.5.1]]
==== Spatial quality

Spatial attribute types must contain a referenced geometry and may be associated with spatial quality attributes. Each spatial attribute instance must be referenced by a feature instance or another spatial attribute instance. Spatial quality attributes are carried in the information type*Spatial Quality*. Only point, multipoint and curve geometry and the Meta feature *Quality of Bathymetric Data*can be associated with spatial quality. Currently no use case for associating surface geometry with spatial quality attributes is known, therefore this is prohibited. Vertical uncertainty is prohibited for curves as this dimension is not supported by curves. Each instance of *Spatial Quality* must be associated to the geometry to which the information applies using the association *Spatial Association* (see clause25.15); or in the case of *Spatial Quality* associated with **Quality of Bathymetric Data**, using the association *Quality of Bathymetric Data Composition* (see clause 25.12).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The sub-complex attributes *horizontal position uncertainty* and *vertical uncertainty* must be encoded using either *Spatial Quality* or the Meta feature *Quality of Bathymetric Data* (see clause 3.8) to provide the spatial accuracy components for provision of an overall indication of the quality of bathymetric data for an area. The decision as to which option to use should be based on whether the horizontal position and vertical uncertainty values are specific to a single *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature or relate to multiple *Quality of Bathymetric Data* features. In general, specific values are related to areas of changeable bathymetry over time or varying bathymetric data quality in the water column (as shown in Figure 3-2 in clause 3.8.1); and common values are specific to general quality uncertainty values in non-changeable areas. It is prohibited to use both options for a single *Quality of Bathymetric Data* instance.
* The complex attribute *spatial accuracy*is used to specify the vertical and horizontal position uncertainty, which may degrade in changeable areas over time. In order to provide the spatial accuracy components for provision of an overall indication of the quality of bathymetric data for an area, an instance of *Spatial Quality* may be associated with one or more instances of *Quality of Bathymetric Data*using the association *Quality of Bathymetric Data Composition* (see clauses 3.8 and 25.12); or encoded using the complex attribute *zone of confidence* on the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* itself. Where the attribute *category of temporal variation* for the associated *Quality of Bathymetric Data* is set to values _2_ (likely to change and significant shoaling expected) or _3_ (likely to change but significant shoaling not expected) and the spatial accuracy is encoded using **Spatial Quality**, multiple instances of *spatial accuracy* should be encoded to provide an indication of the degradation of the vertical and horizontal position accuracy of the charted bathymetric information over time. Where multiple instances of *spatial quality* are encoded, these must correspond to the number of instances and values (including the zone of confidence categories and date ranges) populated for the complex attribute *zone of confidence* on the associated *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature.

** The sub-complex attribute *fixed date range* is used, where required, to define the date range(s) where the spatial accuracy is degraded over time. Where multiple date ranges are specified, the attributes *date start* and *date end* for each instance of *fixed date range* must be equal to the corresponding instances of *zone of confidence* (*fixed date range*) for the associated *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature (see clause 3.8).
** The sub-complex attribute **vertical uncertainty**, where encoded, is used to specify the vertical uncertainty of the depths covered by the associated *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature within a specified date range (where encoded); and should be adjusted to indicate the degradation of the vertical uncertainty over time where multiple instances of *zone of confidence* are encoded (see above). When *depth range minimum value* is specified for the associated *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature, *vertical uncertainty* refers only to the uncertainty of the swept depth defined by *depth range minimum value*.
** The sub-complex attribute **horizontal position uncertainty**, where encoded, is used to specify the positional uncertainty of the depths covered by the associated *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature within a specified date range (where encoded); and should be adjusted to indicate the degradation of the horizontal position uncertainty over time where multiple instances of *zone of confidence* are encoded (see above).
** The sub-attribute *quality of horizontal measurement* must not be populated for *Spatial Quality* associated to *Quality of Bathymetric Data*.
* For the geometry associated with **Obstruction**, **Sounding**,*Underwater/Awash Rock* and *Wreck* features, an instance of *Spatial Quality* using the association *Spatial Association* (see clause 25.15) may be associated to indicate, where required, that the horizontal position and/or the vertical uncertainty for the associated feature is of different (higher or lower) accuracy than indicated by the underlying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* Meta feature. Where *Spatial Quality* is associated to **Obstruction**, *Underwater/Awash Rock* or *Wreck* and attribute *height* or*value of sounding* is populated with an empty (null) value, the value for the attribute *vertical uncertainty* (*uncertainty fixed*) on the associated **Spatial Quality**, where required, must also be populated as empty (null). See also clause3.8.1.3(Sounding uncertainty).
* The attribute *quality of horizontal measurement* may be used on *Spatial Quality* to provide an indication of lower accuracy quality of depth features, in addition to population of **horizontal position accuracy**, than the underlying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* indicates, however where this is done the *Spatial Quality* feature must not be associated to a *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature.

== Association Names

The following diagrams are examples to demonstrate the structure of the feature/feature and feature/information association tables included in the following clauses, as they may be correspondingly represented in UML. The examples are taken from the UML Relationship Diagram for the feature *Two Way Route Part*. The complete relationship diagram is shown in Figure 25-1 below.

[[fig_25-1]]
.Two-Way Route Part UML relationship diagram

NOTE: The association *Spatial Association* (see clause 25.15) is not included in Figure 25-1 above, as this association identifies the relationship between an information type (*Spatial Quality*) and the spatial type to which a feature is bound (that is, the geometry to which the feature is bound, rather than the feature itself).

The tables included in this Section are structured such that each row of the table shows all components of the relationship as they would be included at the association end for the entries included in the "Associated With" column. For example, for the *Two Way Route* end of the *Two-Way Route Aggregation* association (indicated by the red outline included in Figure 25-1 above), the "Role Type" is __Aggregation__; the "Role" is __The Collection__; and the "Multiplicity" is _0,1_ (see clause 25.19):

[cols="68,90,383,69", options="unnumbered"]
|===
h| Role Type h| Role h| Associated With h| Multiplicity
| Aggregation | The Collection | *Two-Way Route* | 0,1

|===

Within the tables, features are grouped in separate table entries where the features included at either end of the relationship may differ for the association. For example Figure 25-2\* below shows that, for the feature/information association **Additional Information**, the feature *Anchor Berth* may be associated with any of the information types **Contact Details**, **Non-Standard Working Day**, *Service Hours* or **Nautical Information**; while the feature *Two Way Route Part* may only be associated with the information type *Nautical Information* (as shown in Figure 25-1 above and Figure 25-5).

In Figure 25-3 above, the table should be interpreted as follows:

* A *Two-Way Route* instance, if it exists, _aggregates_ (or is the container for)_the collection_ of one or more *Two-Way Route Part* features.
* A *Two-Way Route Part* instance is _the_ __component__ (or is a containee) of a *Two-Way Route* feature, if the *Two-Way Route Aggregation* association is created.
* The _1,*_ multiplicity at the *Two-Way Route Part* end of the relationship indicates that, where a *Two-Way Route Aggregation* exists, there must be to at least one *Two-Way Route Part* feature included in the *Two-Way Route Aggregation*. NOTE: This does not mean that all encoded instances of *Two-Way Route Part* must be included in a *Two-Way Route Aggregation* (see next bullet).
* The _0,1_ multiplicity at the *Two-Way Route* end of the relationship indicates that there is no requirement to bind each *Two-Way Route Part* feature to an instance of *Two-Way Route* using a *Two-Way Route Aggregation* (due to the lower multiplicity being zero). However, where the relationship exists, there must be exactly one *Two-Way Route* feature included in the association.

Figure 25-4 below shows the representation of the feature/feature association *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* for the *Two-Way Route Part* feature (see clause 25.19).

* The *Traffic Separation Scheme* may additionally be associated to the aids to navigation marking the components of the Scheme using the association *Aids to Navigation Association* (see clause 25.2).

|===

The components of the feature/feature association *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* should be interpreted as for the corresponding components of the feature/feature association *Two-Way Route Aggregation* described for Figure 25-3, except for the multiplicity at the *Two-Way Route Part* end of the association (indicated with the arrow in Figure 25-4). The multiplicity as indicated in the UML as "0..\* {1..\* [C]}" in this case is an example of "collective multiplicity" notation. Collective multiplicities are described in the following clauses in the Remarks section of the tables.

* A collective multiplicity can only exist when there is more than one feature type that may be used in a given role. A collective multiplicity indicates the multiplicity of the collection.
* The "0..*" component of the multiplicity shown in the UML in this example is the "individual multiplicity". An individual multiplicity indicates the multiplicity for each component of the collection, and in this example indicates that that none of the listed features are required to be included.
* The collective component of the multiplicity ({1..\* [C]} in the UML) indicates that where the association *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* exists, there must be at least one of any of the features (collectively) that may be included as "containees". The allowable list of features is included in the following table entries, noting in this example that at least one instance of *Two-Way Route Part* is allowable, if required, for the *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* (as highlighted in Figure 25-4).
* The individual component of the multiplicity (0,*) indicates there is no requirement for a *Two-Way Route Part* feature (or any other feature in the list) to be included in a *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* (due to the lower multiplicity being zero). However where the relationship exists, there may be an unlimited number of *Two-Way Route Part* features or any other feature included in the list (due to the upper multiplicity being "*").
* Upright style (non-italicized) features in the tables are members of the collective multiplicity, italicized features are not. The individual multiplicity applies to all listed features; the collective multiplicity only applies to the upright features, which may or may not comprise the entire list.

The Tables in this Section show only the individual multiplicity in the "Multiplicity" column. The indication of collective multiplicity is included in the Remarks (in Figure 25-4 above, the Remark "A *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* must, if required, include at least one of any of the features shown in the "The Component" role below in upright text associated to a *Traffic Separation Scheme* feature" indicates the collective multiplicity).

The only additional characteristic to note in Figure 25-5, which is characteristic of all feature/information associations, is that unlike feature/feature associations, feature/information associations have only one role (at the information feature end of the relationship).

Each row included in Figure 25-6 above describes a S-101 association instance that may be created and include one or more instances of the feature type *Lateral Buoy* as a member; and is structured such that all components of the association are grouped as they would appear at the end of the association containing *Lateral Buoy* (see Figure 25-1 and associated guidance).

. The name of the association as specified in the following clauses.
. The list of features that *Lateral Buoy* may be associated to for the association (in UML terms, the list of features at the "other end" of the association).
. The type of association as defined for the *Lateral Buoy* end of the association -- "Association", "Aggregation" or "Composition" as described in S-100 Part 1, clause 1-4.9; and included in the tables in this Section in the "Role Type" column. NOTE: The association type for a feature/information association will always be "Association".
. The role name as defined for the *Lateral Buoy* end of the association and as described in Section 26; and included in the tables in this Section in the "Role" column. NOTE: a dash "-" in this column indicates the one-way nature of a feature/information association -- the role name is included at the information end of the association only.
. The multiplicity as defined for the *Lateral Buoy* end of the association and included in the tables in this Section in the "Multiplicity" column. For **Lateral Buoy**, these multiplicities are interpreted as follows:

* 0,1 for the *Structure/Equipment* association means that a *Lateral Buoy* can exist in isolation (lower multiplicity 0) but, if the association exists, exactly one instance of *Lateral Buoy* must be included in the "The Structure" role of type Composition. The same principle applies for the *Text Association* association.
* 0,\* means that a *Lateral Buoy* can exist in isolation (lower multiplicity 0) but, if the association exists, one or more instances of *Lateral Buoy* may (but are not required) to be included in the association. In general this is an indication of "collective multiplicity" (see Figure 15-4 above and associated guidance).

**To decide on a ZOC Category, all conditions outlined in columns 2 to 4 of the Table must be met.**

Explanatory notes quoted in the Table:

^1 ^ The allocation of a Zone of Confidence (ZOC) indicates that particular data meets minimum criteria for position and depth accuracy and seafloor coverage defined in this Table. ZOC categories reflect a charting standard and not just a hydrographic survey standard. Depth and position accuracies specified for each ZOC category refer to the errors of the final depicted soundings and include not only survey errors but also other errors introduced in the chart production process. Data is further qualified in Meta Feature Type *Quality of Bathymetric Data* (see clause 3.8) and associated Information Type *Spatial Quality* (see clause 24.5) attributes as follows:a) Positional Accuracy (*horizontal position uncertainty*) and Sounding Accuracy (*vertical uncertainty*) on the associated instance of *Spatial Quality* may be used to indicate that a higher position or depth accuracy has been achieved than defined in this Table (for example a survey where full seafloor coverage was not achieved could not be classified higher that ZOC B; however, if the position accuracy was, for instance, ± 15 metres, the attribute *horizontal position uncertainty* could be used to indicate this).b) Swept areas where the clearance depth is accurately known but the actual seabed depth is not accurately known may be accorded a 'higher' ZOC (that is, A1 or A2) providing positional and depth accuracies of the swept depth meets the criteria in this Table. In this instance, the attribute *depth range minimum value* on the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature may be used to specify the swept depth. The position accuracy criteria apply to the boundaries of swept areas.c) The complex attribute *survey date range* on the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature is used to indicate the start and end dates of the survey(s) covering the area.^2^ Position Accuracy of depicted soundings at 95% CI (2.45 sigma) with respect to the given datum. It is the cumulative error and includes survey, transformation and digitizing errors etc. Position accuracy need not be rigorously computed for ZOCs B, C and D but may be estimated based on type of equipment, calibration regime, historical accuracy etc.^3^ Depth accuracy of depicted soundings = a + (b~*~d)/100 at 95% CI (2.00 sigma), where d = depth in metres at the critical depth. Depth accuracy need not be rigorously computed for ZOCs B, C and D but may be estimated based on type of equipment, calibration regime, historical accuracy etc.^4 ^ Significant seafloor features are defined as those rising above depicted depths by more than:DepthSignificant Featurea. <40 m 2 mb. >40 m 10% depthA full seafloor search indicates that a systematic survey was conducted using detection systems, depth measurement systems, procedures, and trained personnel designed to detect and measure depths on significant seafloor features. Significant features are included on the chart as scale allows. It is impossible to guarantee that no significant feature could remain undetected, and significant features may have become present in the area since the time of the survey.^5 ^ Typical Survey Characteristics -- these descriptions should be seen as indicative examples only.^6^ Controlled, systematic surveys (ZOC A1, A2 and B) -- surveys comprising planned survey lines, on a geodetic datum that can be transformed to WGS 84.^7^ Modern survey echo sounder -- high precision single beam depth measuring equipment, generally including all survey echo sounders designed post 1970.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The official legal status of each kind of restricted area defines the kind of restriction(s), for example the restriction for a "game preserve" may be "entry prohibited", the restriction for a "fish sanctuary" may be "fishing restricted".

=== scale minimum (SCAMIN)

[cols=1]
|===
| IHO Definition: *SCALE MINIMUM*. The minimum scale at which the feature may be used for example for ECDIS presentation.

Attribute Type: IntegerIndication: The modulus of the scale is indicated, that is 1:89 999 is encoded as 89999.

Unit: NoneMinimum range: 999Maximum range: 19999999Range closure: Closed interval (_minimum ≤_ _*scale minimum*_ _≤ maximum_)Example: If a particular minimum scale is specified as 1:89 999 (encoded as *89999*), and an example of a smaller scale would be 1:179 999 (encoded as *179999*).

The *scale minimum* value of a feature determines the display scale below which the feature is no longer displayed. Its purpose is to reduce clutter, to prioritise the display of features and to improve display speed. In encoding its value, the producing authority should consider these factors, as well as the scale at which the feature is no longer likely to be required for navigation. In order to optimize the performance and clarity of the ENC, it is a mandatory requirement on ENCs that *scale minimum* is used.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* *scale minimum* only affects the display of a feature on an ECDIS, not its presence in the Electronic Navigational Data Service (ENDS).
* If *scale minimum* is not encoded, the feature is displayed at all scales.
* Where *scale minimum* is used, it must always be set to a scale less (that is, to a smaller scale) than the optimum display scale of the data as described in clause 2.5.5. Failure to follow this rule will mean that features will not be displayed on the ECDIS until the overscale indication is activated. See clause 2.5.9, Table 2-6, for the list of mandatory *scale minimum* values.
* Skin of the Earth and Meta features must always be displayed. Therefore, *scale minimum* must not be encoded on Skin of the Earth and Meta features.
* If the same feature exists in datasets of different optimum display scales, the same *scale minimum* value must be assigned to each occurrence of the feature.

=== default clearance depth

[cols="651,80,79,96,80,96", options="unnumbered"]
|===
| IHO Definition: *DEFAULT CLEARANCE DEPTH*. The depth value determined for an underwater hazard of unknown depth, based on the depth of the surrounding area.

Attribute Type: RealUnit: Defined as an attribute in the ENC Dataset Discovery Metadata: metre (m)Precision: 0∙1mMinimum range: -30Maximum range: 12500Range closure: Open interval (_minimum <_ _*default clearance depth*_ _< maximum_)Examples:*12.5* for a default clearance depth of 12.5 metres**-2.4** for a drying default clearance height of 2∙4 metres

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The attribute *default* *clearance depth* must be populated with a value, which must not be an empty (null) value, only if the attribute *value of sounding* for the feature instance is populated with an empty (null) value and the attribute **height**, if an allowable attribute for the feature, is not populated.
* The value for *default clearance depth* is determined from the attribute *depth range minimum value* for the surrounding encoded *Depth Area*(s) or *Dredged Area* (see clauses 11.4 and 11.7) in accordance with the Tables below. For an area feature covered by more than one depth area, the *default clearance depth* is determined based on the *depth range minimum**value* of the shoalest of the depth areas covering the feature.
* The auto-populated value for *default clearance depth* may be amended by the Data Producer if the resulting isolated danger indication in the ECDIS is not considered appropriate (if, for example, it is known that vessels having a draught deeper than 20.1 metres are able to navigate safely in the area; or if the Data Producer wishes to indicate that only vessels to a specified draught that is less than 20 metres may navigate safely in the area).
* A drying height is indicated by a negative value.
The following Tables provide an indication for the values (if relevant) to be populated for the attribute *default clearance depth*. The Tables have been partitioned such that the top section has the precondition that the target feature (**Obstruction**, *Underwater/Awash Rock* or *Wreck*) is completely covered by *Depth Area* and/or *Dredged Area* feature(s) having a known value for the attribute **depth range minimum value**; and the bottom section has the precondition that the target feature is of unknown depth (attribute *value of sounding* = Unknown) and is completely or partially covered by an *Unsurveyed Area* feature, or a *Depth Area* and/or *Dredged Area* feature having an unknown value for the attribute *depth range minimum value*. In the Tables:

* The symbol "/" indicates that this attribute is not relevant for the feature instance and therefore is not present. Where "/" appears in the *default clearance depth* column, the attribute must not be populated.
* A blank indicates that the attribute may have any allowable value, including an unknown (empty (null)) value. For non-mandatory attributes, a blank also indicates that the attribute may not be present.
* Where attribute values are quoted:

** Enumerate values separated by commas indicate that any one of the listed values may be populated;
**"Known" means that the attribute is mandatory and has been populated with a value;
**"Unknown" means that the attribute is mandatory and is therefore present, but has not been populated with a value;
**"Empty (null)" means that the attribute is not mandatory, but is present and has no value. For the purposes of these Tables, "Empty (null)" also equates to the non-mandatory attribute not being present for the feature instance.
**"Least Depth" in the *default clearance depth* column is related to the underlying Skin of the Earth depth feature(s) where the value for attribute *depth range minimum value* for the covering *Depth Area* and/or *Dredged Area* feature(s) is known, and is determined as follows:

*** For features of geometric primitive point covered by a *Depth Area* or *Dredged Area* feature; or for features of geometric primitive curve or surface covered by a single *Depth Area* or *Dredged Area* feature, the value of the attribute *depth range minimum value* for the *Depth Area* or *Dredged Area*.
*** For features of geometric primitive curve or surface covered by multiple *Depth Area* and/or *Dredged Area* features, the shoalest value of the attribute *depth range minimum value* for the *Depth Area*/*Dredged Area* features.

| IHO Definition: *SURROUNDING DEPTH*. The depth value determined for seabed around an underwater hazard, based on the depth of the surrounding area.

Attribute Type: RealUnit: Defined as an attribute in the ENC Dataset Discovery Metadata: metre (m)Precision: 0∙1mMinimum range: -30Maximum range: 12500Range closure: Open interval (_minimum <_ _*surrounding depth*_ _< maximum_)Example:*20* for a surrounding depth of 20 metres

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The value for *surrounding depth* is determined from the attribute *depth range minimum value* for the surrounding encoded *Depth Area*(s) or *Dredged Area* (see clauses 11.4 and 11.7). For an area feature covered by more than one depth area, the *surrounding depth* is determined as the *depth range minimum**value* of the deeper of the depth areas covering the feature.
* *surrounding depth* must be populated with a value, which must not be an empty (null) value.
* For features that fall entirely within an *Unsurveyed Area* feature, *surrounding depth* must be populated with value _0_. If an area feature falls partly within *Unsurveyed Area* and partly within *Depth Area* or *Dredged Area* features, *surrounding depth* must be populated in accordance with the first bullet above.
* *surrounding depth* is used by the production software to determine the depth value to be used by the ECDIS at which a feature is to be considered to be in "safe" or "unsafe" water based on the Mariner's selected safety depth.

== Updating (see S-4 -- B-600)

[underline]#Remarks:#

* An ENC Update will be rejected by the ECDIS if it is located outside the area of data coverage for the dataset (that is, area covered by the Meta feature *Data Coverage* with attribute *category of coverage* = _1_ (coverage available)) or if it changes the extent of this area. Where the area of data coverage for a base ENC dataset is to be changed, this must be done by issuing a New Edition of the dataset.
* It has been reported that some ECDIS experience problems in loading large Update datasets. Therefore, as a guide, ENC Updates should not exceed 50 Kilobytes in size.
* It has been reported that grouping new or modified soundings into existing sounding groups (see clause 11.3) in an ENC Update negatively impacts the discovery of the changes to the bathymetry by Mariners. Therefore, encoders are advised that soundings added or modified as part of an ENC Update should be encoded as individual sounding objects or, if in close proximity, may be included as a single grouped sounding object. When a New Edition of the ENC is produced, soundings may be re-grouped in accordance with the Data Producer's standard practices.
* When updating the geometry of curve features, compilers must note S-101 clause X.

X regarding the requirement for the vector records making up the curve feature to be referenced sequentially. Additionally, for curve features comprising multiple edges, the end node of a vector record must be the same as the start node of the following vector record. It has been reported that some ECDIS reject ENC Updates where the geometry does not conform to these requirements.

[[sec_31.1]]
=== Issuing Updates in advance

Under certain conditions, it may be necessary for a Data Producer to issue Update information in advance. For example, a change in a traffic routeing system must be made public before the new situation is implemented. Within an Update dataset there is no means of indicating the date at which an Update must be applied. Therefore, when an Update dataset is received by an end-user, it must be applied immediately. To avoid situations where Update information would cause target data to reflect a situation that does not yet exist, the following encoding rules must be followed:

a) If the advance Update information contained in the Update message involves the addition of features to the existing data (for example a new lighthouse), the *date start* sub-attribute for the complex attribute *fixed* **date range** on the new features must contain the date at which the Update becomes active.

b) If the advance Update information contained in the Update message involves the modification of existing features (for example a change in a traffic routeing system), it must be treated as a deletion of the existing features and replacement with new features. See a) above and c) below.

c) If the advance Update information contained in the Update message involves the deletion of existing features (for example the removal of a buoy), the Update message must set the *end date* sub-attribute for the complex attribute *fixed* **date range** of all features to be deleted to the date at which the Update becomes active. *NB*. This Update message does not actually delete the features from the dataset, it simply indicates that on the date held in the *date end* sub-attribute for the complex attribute *fixed* **date range** they become obsolete. A further Update to actually delete the obsolete features from the dataset should be sent at the time that the change in the real world occurs.

d) To highlight to the Mariner that the advance Update information contained in an Update message will take place in the future, it is recommended that a *Caution Area* feature (see clause 16.10) be created covering the location at which the future changes will take place. A warning note specifying, in plain language, the nature of the future change should be encoded, using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6). The sub-attribute *date end* for the complex attribute *fixed* **date range** on the *Caution Area* must be set to the date at which the change described in the Update becomes active.

Changes to the *date start* and *date end* for *fixed* **date range** cannot be applied to spatial types. Therefore, a change to the geometry of a real world feature (for example the relocation of a buoy) to be applied in the future can only be achieved by updating all of the geo and spatial types involved.

As a consequence of issuing advance information Updates, more than one instance of a particular real world feature could exist in the dataset.

Further information regarding issuing Update information in advance as an equivalent to the paper chart Preliminary Notices to Mariners process can be found at clause 31.2.3.

[[sec_31.1.1]]
==== Advance notification of changes to traffic separation schemes

It is important that Mariners be provided with advance notification of changes to traffic separation schemes (TSS), which may include modification to an existing TSS, addition of a new TSS or removal of a TSS. In order to provide a consistent approach to Mariners regarding advance notification of changes to a traffic separation scheme, the following procedure should be adopted:

1) At least one month before the changes to the TSS come into force, issue an updated dataset (as an Update or a New Edition) which:

* Adds new or amended TSS component features. These features must have *date start* for *fixed* **date range** populated with the date that the changes to the TSS come into force.
* Adds *date end* for *fixed* **date range** (populated with the date of the day before the changes to the TSS come into force) to any component features of the existing TSS that are to be changed or deleted.
* Creates a *Caution Area* surface feature (see clause 16.10) covering the geographic extent of both the current and the future TSS. The complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) must be used to explain the change to the TSS, for example_"The traffic separation scheme off Cape Bon is to be modified at 0000 UTC on 1 July 2009. This ENC includes all the information before and after the change, indicated by the sub-attributes_ __**date end**__ _(before the change) and_ __**date start**__ _(after the change) for the complex attribute_ __**fixed** __ __**date range**__ _on the components of the scheme"_. The sub-attribute *date end* on *fixed* **date range** for the *Caution Area* should be populated with the date at which the change comes into force or, if encoders wish to provide extended information to the Mariner that a change has been made, with a date up to a month after the change comes into force. If the current and the future TSS are not in the same geographic area, it may be required to encode two distinct *Caution Area* surface features. A picture file may be referenced by the *Caution Area* using the attribute *pictorial representation* if it is considered useful, for example the equivalent paper chart representation of the amended or new TSS.

2) As soon as possible after the modified/new/deleted TSS comes into force, issue an updated dataset (as an Update or New Edition) which:

* Deletes the changed or redundant component features of the former TSS.
* Removes the attribute *fixed date range* from the component features of the new TSS.

3) The *Caution Area* must also be removed by Update, either as part of the Update to remove the redundant component features of the former TSS, or as a separate Update at a later date, corresponding to the date populated in the sub-attribute *date end* for the complex attribute *fixed* **date range** for the *Caution Area*.

Encoders who are members of RENCs should also provide advance notification of changes to TSS to their RENC in accordance with RENC procedures, in order for the RENC to provide additional notification to Mariners of impending TSS changes.

=== Guidelines for encoding Temporary and Preliminary ENC Updates

[[sec_31.2.1]]
==== Introduction

The following provides high level guidance for the promulgation of the equivalent of paper chart Temporary (T) and Preliminary (P) Notices to Mariners (NMs) via ENC Updates. This guidance allows for some latitude in its application and is dependent on the assessment of each particular case, and as such relies ultimately on the judgement of each ENC Producing Authority.

[[sec_31.2.2]]
==== Temporary (T) Notices to Mariners (see S-4 -- B-633)

. Temporary Notices to Mariners, (T)NMs, for paper charts are defined in S-4, Section B-600. A (T)NM promulgates navigationally significant information that will remain valid only for a limited period of time.

For the paper chart, the convention is for the Mariner to insert the Update on the chart in pencil, and erase it when the (T)NM is cancelled.

S-101 provides mechanisms which allow ENCs to be automatically updated. This allows the affected ENC(s) to be continually updated in a timely manner for the duration of the NM without additional workload for the Mariner.

Producing Authorities must promulgate temporary information which is safety-related or which otherwise needs to be advised to the Mariner urgently by ENC Update to provide the ECDIS user with an updated System Database. This service corresponds to the service that (T)NMs offer to the paper chart user.

[start=2]
. Update encoding for an ENC and (T)NM for the paper chart are two completely different communication processes for promulgating information to the Mariner. Since these processes are different (but not supposed to be independent), and the products to which they apply are also different, it is recommended that ENC Updates be derived from the source information rather than the paper chart (T)NM. Often the (T)NM for paper chart does not provide enough detail to apply the relevant ENC Update.
. If possible the information should be encoded with the relevant features. However, HOs should consider the following:

* An ENC Update must not be initiated if the information will no longer be valid by the time it is received by the Mariner; this will depend upon the timescales relating to the Producer Nation's ENC Updating regime. Shorter time periods may be covered by Radio Navigational Warnings (RNW). If known, the ENC Update should include an indication of how long the temporary change will remain in force.

* If it is unlikely that the HO will be notified when a temporary change will revert to its original charted state, the HO should consider an alternative method such as a general note or by issuing an ENC Update explaining, for example, that the aids to navigation within an area are reported to be unreliable.

It is important that HOs should consider constraints of time when identifying the encoding method. Time consuming and unnecessarily complex methods of encoding should be avoided.

[start=4]
.. The overuse of *Caution Area* features (especially *Caution Area* of type surface -- see clause 16.10) for temporary information should be avoided. The *Caution Area* feature is used when it is relevant for the situation and/or when a particular change needs a special warning. *Caution Area* may be used when the relevant features cannot be encoded, for example information cannot be displayed clearly or cannot be easily promulgated due to time constraints.
.. To correctly encode an ENC Update the source information is essential in determining which elements of the Update are reliable, which are permanent and which are temporary. The attribute *status* with value _7_ (temporary) should only be used in an Update when it is certain that the status of a feature is confirmed as temporary.
.. Use of complex attribute *fixed* **date range**:

The earliest date on which a feature will be present (*date start*) and the latest date on which a feature will be present (*date end*) must only be encoded when known. Where such dates have been encoded for any feature that is the structure component of a *Structure/Equipment* feature association, all other component features within the relationship must not extend beyond the temporal attribute values encoded for the structure feature.

The ENC Update should be issued as close as possible to the earliest date of the change (*date start*), unless it is appropriate to provide the information well in advance. A feature no longer present should be removed from the display by issuing a further Update as soon as possible after the return to the original charted state (*date end*). The timing of the issue of these Updates will depend upon the Producing Authorities ENC Updating regime and its corresponding timescales.

When an ENC Update promulgates information well in advance and uses *fixed* **date range**, a *Caution Area* feature may be used in order to inform Mariners that temporal information exists at some future point in time.

[start=4]
.. The complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6), sub-attribute *text* should be used as required to provide supplementary or contextual information when encoding temporary (or preliminary) information. When the text is too long to be encoded using *information* (*text*) (see clause 27.177), the complex attribute **information**, sub-attribute *file reference* should be used to encode a reference to an ENC support file. Encoders using *information* to provide positional information must express the coordinate values in WGS 84 and in accordance with S-4 -- B-131. If it is deemed necessary a picture file (referenced using attribute *pictorial representation*) may be included.
.. ENC Updates issued for temporary information should be carefully managed and reviewed regularly to consider whether further action is necessary. New information may have been received that necessitates the issuing of a new Update to modify or cancel the previous one. Producing Authorities should make it easy to recover the original charted state before the temporary changes came into effect.
.. Further verification is recommended to make sure that the encoded ENC Update is consistent with the corresponding paper chart Notice to Mariners.
.. Guidelines for typical cases:

[type=a]
. Individual new physical features (for example wreck, buoy) with no associated explicit or implicit area associated (for example restricted area):

* Encode the relevant S-101 feature.
* In this instance a *Caution Area* feature would not normally be used.

[start=2,type=a]
.. Individual new physical feature(s) with an associated explicit area around it:

*** Encode the relevant S-101 surface feature (for example *Restricted Area*). The relevant feature is encoded for the new physical feature. However, when the area is an "entry prohibited area" or a *Caution Area* feature the new physical feature(s) may be omitted to simplify encoding unless it is navigationally significant.
.. Individual new physical feature with a notification of caution, for example "Mariners are advised to navigate with caution…":

* Encode the relevant S-101 feature. Additional clarification and advice may, if required, be provided using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6). Exceptionally, a *Caution Area* feature may be encoded to highlight the caution if considered necessary.

[start=4,type=a]
. Obstructions (including wrecks) reported to exist within an area:

** Encode an *Obstruction* or *Wreck* feature of type surface (see clauses 13.6 and 13.5).
. New simple surface feature (military practice area, dredged area):

* Encode the relevant S-101 surface feature.
* Supplementary information is provided using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).
* Normally, a *Caution Area* feature is not added.

[start=6,type=a]
.. Complex information within an area (for example works in progress where the changes are numerous or involve complex changes to the topology):

*** Encode the surface feature. It should be encoded with the relevant S-101 feature or, if more suitable or by default, a *Caution Area* feature (see clause 16.10). Supplementary or contextual information is provided using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6). When the available information is sufficiently detailed, navigationally significant features (for example navigational aids, obstructions) should be encoded or modified within the area. When the available information does not permit this, a *Caution Area* feature defining the area is preferred.
.. Changes to an existing feature (for example navigational aid):

* In these instances it is usually only necessary to change the attributes values. A *Caution Area* feature (see clause 16.10) may be used to warn the Mariner if it is considered necessary.

[start=8,type=a]
.. Buoy temporarily moved:

*** When a buoy is temporarily moved then it, and any associated features, are "moved" to the new position and the attribute *status* = _7_ (temporary) is populated. Alternative encodings are possible, for example, if the move is for a fixed period of time. In these cases the feature, and any associated components, can be created in the temporary position with sub-attribute *date end* for the complex attribute *fixed* **date range** populated with the date corresponding to the end of the fixed period of time. The currently charted feature, and any associated components, should have *date start* for the complex attribute *fixed* **date range** also populated with the date corresponding to the end of the fixed period of time. A *Caution Area* feature may, if considered necessary, be added.
.. Light temporarily extinguished:

* The attribute *status* for the *Light* feature is populated with the values _11_ (extinguished) and _7_ (temporary).

[start=10,type=a]
.. Change to a maintained depth in a dredged area:

*** When information is received from an official or recognised survey authority relating to a dredged area where the dredged depth has changed, the attribute value of *depth range minimum value* for the *Dredged Area* feature should be changed to the value provided by the survey.
*** Where a *Sounding* feature is encoded in a dredged area to indicate shoaler depths, the attribute value *exposition of sounding* = _2_ (shoaler than the depth of the surrounding depth area) should not be populated (see clauses 11.3.1 and 11.4.1). Where required, the shoal depths should be encoded using **Sounding**, with the appropriate underlying depth information (*Depth Contour* and *Depth Area*) to support the depths. Alternatively, the attribute *depth range maximum value* for the *Dredged Area* may be set to the designed dredged depth for the dredged area and the attribute *depth range minimum value* set to the value of the shoalest depth, or a *Caution Area* feature may be encoded covering the shoaler depth area with the depth information provided using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6). Where the shoal depths are close to the edge of the dredged area, the dredged area limit may be adjusted to exclude the shoal depths from the area. See also S-4 -- B-414.5.

[[sec_31.2.3]]
==== Preliminary (P) Notices to Mariners (see S-4 -- B-634)

. Preliminary Notices to Mariners, (P)NMs, for paper chart are defined in S-4, Section B-600. A (P)NM promulgates navigationally significant information early to the Mariner, for example when a paper chart new edition cannot be issued in due time.

For the paper chart, the convention is for the Mariner to insert the Update on the chart in pencil, and erase it when the (P)NM is cancelled.

S-101 provides mechanisms which allow ENCs to be automatically updated (Update application profile). This allows the affected ENC(s) to be continually updated in a timely manner for the duration of the NM without additional workload for the Mariner.

Producing Authorities must promulgate preliminary information which is safety-related or which otherwise needs to be advised to the Mariner urgently by ENC Update to provide the ECDIS user with an updated System Database. This method of delivery corresponds to the service that (P)NMs offer to the paper chart user.

[start=2]
. Update encoding for ENC and (P)NM for paper chart are two completely different communication processes for promulgating information to the Mariner.

For example, there are instances when the paper chart needs updating using a NM block (also known as a chartlet or patch) or by issuing a New Edition due to the complexity or volume of changes. This could clutter the paper chart unacceptably if amended by hand and/or overburden the chart corrector. The lead time for a NM block correction or a New Edition can be lengthy, sometimes several months. In these cases a (P)NM may be issued as an interim measure. The ENC Updating mechanisms are more flexible and may allow for ENC Updates to be issued in quicker time. However, experience has shown that large Updates may result in processing issues in the ECDIS, in particular inordinately long loading times. Therefore producing an ENC New Edition may be the better option in some cases.

There may be other instances, when new information is received, where it is not possible to fully update both the ENC and paper chart promptly. For example, not all the information required to produce a chart-updating NM is received by the HO in the first notification (for instance notification of works in progress or projected), or extensive new information requires significant compilation work. In these cases it is still necessary to provide notification of navigationally significant changes to the Mariner in a timely manner.

Since the paper chart and ENC processes are different (but not supposed to be independent), and also the products to which they apply are different, it is recommended that ENC Updates be derived from the source information rather than from the paper chart (P)NM. It is often the case that the paper chart (P)NM does not provide enough detail to encode the ENC Update exactly as it should be.

[start=3]
. Simple or more complex encoding methods are possible but it is important for Producing Authorities to consider carefully which encoding method is appropriate when creating an ENC Update with due consideration for time.
. Often, information received is too complex, extensive and/or imprecise to be encoded with the relevant S-101 features. In these instances the use of a *Caution Area* feature (see clause 16.10) is preferred to give a précis of the overall changes together with detailed navigationally significant information. For complex or extensive changes the *Caution Area* should have the complex attribute **information**,sub-attribute *file reference* referencing a file containing precise details of the preliminary information. See also clause 31.2.2 paragraph 7 above. If the information is less precise then *information* should be used to inform Mariners of this fact.

It is noted that the Mariner, if it is considered necessary, has the facility in the ECDIS to add "Mariner Objects" and annotate them. These can be saved in the System Database based on information provided in textual form using the *information* complex attribute. It is envisaged that these features would be created at the "Route Planning" stage and act as a prompt during the "Route Monitoring" phase.

When information is issued as advance notification for an ENC it is necessary to provide as soon as possible to the Mariner the final and full charted information encoded with the relevant S-101 features. An ENC Update or a New Edition of the ENC dataset should therefore be issued at a later date when the Producing Authority can carry out full encoding of the changes. The period of time will depend on the following:

* the time needed by the HO to undertake the full encoding with relevant features;
* the time needed to obtain confirmation of details; and
* the date at which the real world situation is stabilized and any forecast changes have been completed.

[start=5]
. Source Information received may contain some navigationally significant elements that are simple to encode with the relevant features in a timely manner. In such cases these elements may be encoded with the relevant features provided that they reflect the "real world" situation after the ENC Update is made available to the user. However, if the changes are subject to continual change these features should be amended as a consequence and will represent additional work for the HO. In such cases, the ENC Update should also warn the Mariner that the situation is subject to change. For temporary information, see clause 31.2.2.
. Use of complex attribute *fixed* **date range**: See clause 31.2.2 paragraph 6. For new or amended routeing measures, see clause 31.1.1.
. Use the complex attribute *information*: See clause 31.2.2 paragraph 7.
. Diagrams are sometimes very useful to the Mariner, for example, for indicating changes to complex routeing measures or the introduction of new ones. A picture file may be referenced using the attribute *pictorial representation* in such cases.
. ENC Updates issued for preliminary information should be managed and reviewed regularly. For example further source information may have been acquired requiring a further ENC Update. This may add, modify or cancel information previously promulgated.
. Further verification is recommended to make sure that the encoded ENC Update is consistent with the corresponding paper notice.
. Guidelines for typical cases:

[type=a]
. Traffic separation schemes:

** See clause 31.1.1. For the use of the complex attribute *fixed* **date range**, see also clause 31.2.2 paragraph 6.
. Complex information within an area of change (for example works in progress):

* A *Caution Area* feature (see clause 16.10) should be created to cover the area. Information is provided using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6), sub-attribute **text**, for example __under construction__, or sub-attribute *file reference*to encode a reference to an ENC support file when it is necessary to give more detailed information. If sufficiently detailed information is available, then navigationally significant information such as navigational aids, fairways, regulated areas, etc. can be encoded or modified within the *Caution Area* if time permits. A reference to a picture file may also be included, if required, using the attribute *pictorial representation* on the *Caution Area*.
* Alternatively, and if considered appropriate a *Restricted Area* feature (see clause 17.8), with attribute *restriction* = _7_ (entry prohibited) may be encoded instead of the *Caution Area* feature.

[start=3,type=a]
.. Simple information which does not need an additional notification of caution:

*** The relevant feature(s) and the appropriate attributes should be encoded with any additional contextual information provided using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6). In this case it is not necessary to use a *Caution Area* feature. This could apply, for example, to submarine cables or pipelines being laid (*Cable Submarine* or *Pipeline Submarine/On Land* features), or an area under reclamation (*Land Area* feature with attribute *condition* = _3_ (under reclamation)). If required the encoding should reflect that positions are approximate using the spatial attribute *quality of horizontal measurement*= _4_ (approximate) on the spatial type(s).
.. Depths less than those charted within a defined area:

* If the depth values and their positions are known, *Sounding* features (see clause 11.3) may be created or modified. Any affected depth contours and depth areas should also be amended as necessary. The source of the information should be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6). However, Producing Authorities should carefully consider the time needed to update ENC depth information and the complexity of changes to the topology that may be required.
* The encoding of amended **Sounding**, *Depth Area* and associated features could be inappropriate for promulgating this navigationally significant information within acceptable time scales. In this case a *Caution Area* (see clause 16.10) is the preferred option. In such cases, only the most significant amendments to depth information should be provided using the complex attribute **i****nformation**. This method should also be used if the depth values and/or the exact positions are unknown, or if the Producing Authority only has information relating to a limited number of depth values.

==== ECDIS Chart 1 custom features

If it is required to encode a custom feature required, for example, to encode supporting features such as table structures and texts used in the ECDIS Chart 1 datasets, it must be done using the feature *Chart 1 Feature*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The *Chart 1 Feature* must only be used for specific purposes such as within test datasets and the ECDIS Chart 1 datasets. It is prohibited to use *Chart 1 Feature* in navigational ENC datasets.
* The attribute *drawing instruction* must be populated, if required, with one or more symbol instructions as defined in S-100 Part 9a.
* If it is required for textual information related to a *Chart 1 Feature* instance to be included in the ECDIS display, this must be done by populating the complex attribute **feature name**, sub-attribute *name usage* with value _1_ (default name display) for the *feature name* instance. To locate the text at the appropriate position (for example for an instance of *Chart 1 Feature* encoded only to include textual information in the dataset), this must be done, if required, using an associated instance of the Cartographic feature *Text Placement* (see clause 23.1). If it is required to restrict the inclusion of the contents of *feature name* only to the ECDIS Pick Report, *name usage* must not be populated for the *feature name* instance. See also clause 2.5.8.
