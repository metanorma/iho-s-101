== Geo Features -- Aids to Navigation -- Overview

In the context of this Product Specification, the following generic
term definitions apply:

*Beacon:* A fixed artificial navigation mark that can be recognised
by its shape, colour, pattern, topmark or light character, or a
combination of these. It may carry various additional aids to
navigation. This term is not commonly used when the navigation mark
can be classified as a lighthouse. (IHO Dictionary - S-32).

*Buoy:* A floating object moored to the bottom in a particular
(charted) place, as an aid to navigation or for other specific
purposes. Navigational buoys may be classified according to: (a)
their shape, appearance, or construction, such as barrel, can, cask,
conical, cylindrical, dan, keg, nun, pillar, spar, spherical, or
topmark buoy; (b) their colour, such as black, chequered, green, red
buoy; (c) their location, such as bifurcation, fairway, junction,
mid-channel, middle-ground, or turning buoy; (d) the various kinds of
hazards or dangers to navigation which they mark, such as bar,
isolated danger, fish trap, obstruction, spoil ground, telegraph or
wreck buoy; (e) their particular purpose or use, such as anchor,
anchorage, compass adjustment, dredging, farewell (or landfall),
marker, quarantine, station (or watch), or warping buoy. (IHO
Dictionary - S-32).

=== Geo features forming parts of navigational aids

Aids to navigation are composed of fixed or floating structure
features established specifically as an aid to navigation, which may
carry equipment features.

When identifying relationships (associations) between aids to
navigation and associated geo features within this document, three
"base classes" are used to define the aids to navigation geo features
included in the relevant association. These "base classes" are:

* Structure Features: Includes *Cardinal Beacon*, *Cardinal Buoy*,
*Daymark*, *Emergency Wreck Marking Buoy*, *Installation Buoy*,
*Isolated Danger Beacon*, *Isolated Danger Buoy*, *Lateral Beacon*,
*Lateral Buoy*, *Light Float*, *Light Vessel*, *Landmark*, *Pile*,
*Safe Water Beacon*, *Safe Water Buoy*, *Special Purpose/General
Beacon*, *Special Purpose/General Buoy*.
* Equipment Features: Includes *Daymark*, *Fog Signal*, *Helipad*
(exceptionally, see 2^nd^ Remarks bullet below), *Light Air
Obstruction*, *Light All Around*, *Light Fog Detector*, *Light
Sectored*, *Physical AIS Aid to Navigation*, *Radar Reflector*,
*Radar Transponder Beacon*, *Retroreflector*, *Signal Station
Traffic*, *Signal Station Warning*.
* Navigational Aid Features: Includes *Cardinal Beacon*, *Cardinal
Buoy*, *Daymark*, *Emergency Wreck Marking Buoy*, *Installation
Buoy*, *Isolated Danger Beacon*, *Isolated Danger Buoy*, *Lateral
Beacon*, *Lateral Buoy*, *Light Float*, *Light Vessel*, *Pile*, *Safe
Water Beacon*, *Safe Water Buoy*, *Special Purpose/General Beacon*,
*Special Purpose/General Buoy*.

The encoding of relationships between structure and equipment
features is described in <<sec_18.2>>.

[underline]#Remarks:# Exceptionally,

* Structures that have not been established specifically as an aid to
navigation may also carry aids to navigation as equipment features.
These include *Bridge*, *Building*, *Cable Overhead*, *Conveyor*,
*Crane*, *Dolphin*, *Floating Dock*, *Fortified Structure*, *Fishing
Facility*, *Hulk*, *Landmark*, *Offshore Platform*, *Pipeline
Overhead*, *Pontoon*, *Pylon/Bridge Support*, *Obstruction*,
*Shoreline Construction*, *Silo/Tank*, *Span Fixed*, *Span Opening*,
*Wind Turbine*, *Wreck*. If it is required to encode such supporting
structures at the same location as an equipment feature, it must be
encoded as a separate feature, and share the same spatial type as
(for point structures), or cover the location of (for structures of
type curve or area) the equipment feature.
* Substantive structures, which may carry helipads, erected in the
water and intended to perform the function of light support must be
encoded, where required, using the feature *Landmark* (see
<<sec_7.2;and!sec_25.16>>). Exceptionally, *Helipad* features may
also, if required, be associated to *Building*, *Landmark* or
*Offshore Platform* features that do not additionally perform the
function of a support for an aid to navigation, using the feature
association *Structure/Equipment* (see <<sec_18.2>>).
* Topmarks are encoded as part of the navigational aid structure,
using the complex attribute *topmark* (see <<sec_29.34>>).
* Radar reflectors must not be encoded as separate features when
attached to navigational aids. If it is required to encode their
existence, it must be done by populating the Boolean attribute *radar
conspicuous* = _True_. Radar reflectors may only be encoded where
their position is known and they are included as equipment features
on an overhead cable structure feature (see
<<sec_6.10.1;and!sec_20.18.1;and!sec_25.15>>).
* Rescue stations and coast guard stations are not related to
navigation, and they must not, therefore, be part of the equipment
features of navigational aids. If it is required to encode a rescue
or coast guard station at the same location as a navigational mark,
it must be encoded as a separate feature, and share the same spatial
type as the navigational aid.

[[sec_18.2]]
=== Relationships

A *Structure/Equipment* feature association (see <<sec_25.16>>) must
be created in order to relate the different features comprising a
navigational aid. Where a *Structure/Equipment* feature association
is created, there must be only one structure feature related to one
or more equipment features. An equipment feature must not be related
to more than one structure feature.

[[fig_18-1]]
.Navigational aids -- Structure/equipment association
image::figure-18-1.png[]

Note that *Daymark* may be a structure feature or an equipment
feature (refer to the lists of structure and equipment features at
<<sec_18.1>>); where a navigational aid contains a *Daymark* and
there is no other base structure (which can serve as the structure
feature) indicated on the source, the *Daymark* feature should be
encoded as the structure feature. A single *Daymark* feature instance
must not be both a structure and an equipment feature.

When the nature of the base structure on land is unknown or there is
no structure feature, one of the equipment features may be chosen as
the structure feature, giving priority to a *Light All Around* or
*Light Sectored* feature, if one exists (however, see also
<<sec_19.1.8>>). Where this occurs, the light feature must be encoded
as the structure feature in the *Structure/Equipment* relationship.
Alternatively, a *Pile* feature of type point or a *Special
Purpose/General Beacon* feature may be encoded as the structure
feature at the same position as the equipment features. When a light
is located in the water with no indication on the source of the
structure feature, regardless of the height of the light, a *Pile*
feature of type surface or a *Special Purpose/General Beacon* feature
should be encoded as the structure feature. This will ensure that a
symbol will be shown on ECDIS systems when the light features are not
displayed during daytime navigation.

[[fig_18-2]]
.Navigational aids -- Structure/equipment feature associations:
Real-world examples
image::figure-18-2.png["",561,240]

In the above real-world examples, the structure and equipment
features that make up the navigational aids are point spatial types,
and they mustshare the same geographic point spatial type.

If it is required to encode the name of the navigational aid, it must
be done using the complex attribute *feature name* (see
<<sec_2.5.8>>) on the structure feature. The name must not be
repeated for the equipment features. If the name is painted on the
structure, it must be encoded with the same spelling in the complex
attribute *feature name*. If the name is not based on the Latin
alphabet, it must be encoded using *feature name* (*name*), with an
appropriate value populated for the sub-attribute *language*, and
transliterated for encoding on an iteration of *feature name*
(*name*) with an appropriate value populated for the mandatory
attribute *language* (normally English (_eng_)).

All point features comprising a navigational aid must share the same
geographic point spatial instance.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For guidance related to the population of the temporal attributes
*date end* and *date start* for equipment features in a
*Structure/Equipment* association relationship, see <<sec_2.4.9>>.

=== Buoyage systems and direction of buoyage (see S-4 -- B-461)

Systems of buoyage are described as lateral, cardinal, or a
combination of lateral and cardinal. Lateral systems depend on a
direction of buoyage being defined. The cardinal system depends
solely on the main points of the compass. Special purpose buoys often
mark the limits or centre of an area (for example an exercise area, a
dumping ground) and do not necessarily have lateral or cardinal
system characteristics.

The IALA Maritime Buoyage System details, including the extent of
Regions A and B, are given in other publications (for example UK's
booklet NP 735 "IALA Maritime Buoyage System"). Although it is called
a buoyage system, it applies to all fixed and floating marks except
lighthouses, some sector lights, leading lights and marks, major
floating lights and lights on offshore structures. Six types of marks
are provided by the system: Lateral, Cardinal, Isolated danger, Safe
water, Special and Emergency Wreck Marking marks, which may be used
in any combination.

[[sec_18.3.1]]
==== Buoyage systems and direction of buoyage (see S-4 -- B-461)

The buoyage system of the area covered by the dataset and, where
necessary, the direction of buoyage, must be encoded using the Meta
features *Navigational System of Marks* and *Local Direction of
Buoyage*:

All parts of the dataset containing data must be covered by
*Navigational System of Marks* features (see <<sec_3.6>>), with the
mandatory attribute *marks navigational -- system of* indicating the
buoyage system in operation. *Navigational System of Marks* features
must not overlap.

Within a dataset, there may be some areas where the direction of
buoyage is defined by local rules and must, therefore, be specified.
These areas should be encoded as separate *Local Direction of
Buoyage* features (see <<sec_3.7>>), with the mandatory attribute
*orientation value* indicating the direction of buoyage. *Local
Direction of Buoyage* features must not overlap, but in areas where
local buoyage directions apply, *Local Direction of Buoyage* features
must overlap *Navigational System of Marks* features (see
<<fig_18-3>> below).

[[fig_18-3]]
.Buoyage system and direction
image::figure-18-3.png[492,210]

Individual buoys and beacons may not be part of the general buoyage
system. This should be encoded using the attribute *marks
navigational -- system of* on these buoy and beacon features.

[[sec_18.3.1.1]]
===== Encoding IALA marks within IALA A or B

In the following Tables the symbol '/' indicates that this attribute
is not relevant for that particular feature class. The Tables contain
the most common examples of encoding; other encoding combinations are
possible. For encoding of buoys, substitute *Buoy* for *Beacon* in
the Feature column. <<table_18-3>> for topmarks refers to the
sub-attribute values for the complex attribute *topmark*.

++*++ If it is required to encode an aid to navigation that may be
considered to be a topmark but has multiple colours that are
considered important for navigation, this should be done using the
feature *Daymark* (see <<sec_20.14>>).
