=== Generalisation of depth portrayal

When a survey or chart is reduced in scale the generalization that
is required has several effects:

a. Deeper soundings tend to be eliminated while the shoaler ones are
retained for safety. Sufficient numbers of deeper soundings should be
retained to show the full range of depth. This is to assist the
navigator who uses their echo sounder to help verify their position,
or the Mariner choosing an anchorage of suitable depth.

b. Generalization proceeds by the inclusion of shoals lying to
seaward of the principal contour, and by the smoothing of severely
indented contours, with the effect of pushing the contours seaward.
However, as a shoal which rises steeply from deep water is much more
of a hazard than one which rises gradually, the encoder must ensure
that the contours are not pushed seaward unduly. If the encoder gives
the impression that a Mariner will get warning of too close an
approach to the danger, by relying on their echo sounder to show
gradually shoaling depth - when the danger is, in fact "steep-to" -
they may seriously mislead and endanger the ENC user.

c. With the "expansion" of shoals, described above, it may become
increasingly difficult to find space on an ENC dataset to show the
line of deepest soundings through a channel, or even to show a
channel at all. Yet even at small optimum display scales it is
important to show the usable channels and indicate their least depth.
The encoder may have to make greater use of depth contours than
soundings in depicting narrow channels.

d. Even such dangers as drying rocks and islets require
generalization in coastal areas. This is in recognition of the
principle that, whereas they are particularly dangerous in isolation
and must then be shown as precisely as possible, where they occur in
groups a representative depiction is permissible, showing the
outermost features as individually as space permits.

[[sec_11.2]]
=== Representation of depth: General

Some of the principles of depth depiction are summarized below:

. The least depth over shoals and banks, and over sills (bars) in
navigable channels, must be shown. Particular attention should also
be paid to full and accurate representation of all other "critical"
areas, for example on and adjacent to leading lines, controlling
depths in fairways and along recommended tracks, in anchorages,
alongside jetties, quays and berths and in the entrances to harbours
and basins. Maximum as well as minimum depth should be shown where
possible, for example to show the line of deepest water in narrow
channels. However, deeper soundings on the sloping side of a bank
near to the crest line should not be selected if they could give the
impression that there is a deeper passage across the crest between
shoaler soundings.

. Soundings and contours must be used to complement each other in
giving a reasonable representation of the seabed, including all
significant breaks of slope.

. The density of soundings should be determined by the type of
seabed. Flat or evenly sloping areas, and banks of unconsolidated
sediment, should have a minimum of soundings, fairly evenly spaced,
but gradually becoming more widely spaced as the depth increases.
Irregular seabed topography should be represented by a denser, and
probably irregular, pattern of soundings. A steep gradient should be
represented by close contours, undistorted by soundings.

. In changeable areas, where surveys of different dates adjoin and do
not match exactly, gaps in the contours may be left to indicate the
discontinuity of depth to the navigator.

. Where practicable, soundings on smaller optimum display scale ENCs
should be selected from those shown on the larger optimum display
scale ENCs.

. In areas navigable only at high water, drying heights must be
selected according to the same principles as soundings.

. Where surveys are inadequate, it may be advisable to omit some of
the standard contour lines.

==== Soundings (see S-4 -- B-412 and B-413.1)

A sounding associated with a rock or coral pinnacle which is an
obstruction to navigation must be encoded using the feature
*Underwater/Awash Rock* (INT1 -- K14, see <<sec_13.4>>) with
attribute *value of sounding* populated with the value of the
sounding.

The geometry of soundings and no bottom found depths (see
<<sec_11.8>>) is held in a 3-dimensional array (latitude, longitude,
depth). In the interests of efficiency, multiple soundings should be
encoded in one spatial type (known as "grouping" of soundings),
provided that all the spatial and geo feature attributes are common
to the group and all soundings in the group are related to the same
sounding datum (see <<sec_3.9>>).

As the sounding multiplication factor (CMFZ) for ENC is 10, soundings
may be encoded to one decimal place of a metre. Drying soundings must
be indicated by a negative value.

For soundings surrounded by a danger line, see
<<sec_13.1;and!sec_13.2>>.

Population of the attributes *quality of vertical measurement*,
*reported date* and the spatial attribute *quality of horizontal
measurement* are described in the Table below:

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Encoders are advised to use caution when considering encoding
soundings that are shoaler than the range of depth of the surrounding
depth area, as *Sounding* features will not be displayed when
utilising some ECDIS display settings. Where it is considered that a
sounding that is shoaler than the range of depth of the surrounding
depth area may be a hazard to navigation, encoders should preferably
conduct further investigation of source material in order to encode
additional depth contour and depth area information more relevant to
the sounding. Alternatively, encoders may consider using an alternate
feature (for example *Obstruction*) to encode the depth.
* The attribute *technique of vertical measurement* must only be
populated for *Sounding* features if it is different from the value
of *technique of vertical measurement* encoded on an overlapping
*Quality of Survey* feature (see <<sec_3.11>>); and the information
is considered to be important to navigation.
* Where *Sounding* features are covered by the Meta feature *Quality
of Survey*, the attribute *quality of vertical measurement* must not
be populated unless different from the value of *quality of vertical
measurement* populated for the *Quality of Survey*.
* An instance of the information type *Spatial Quality* (see
<<sec_25.4>>) may be associated to the sounding geometry, using the
association *Spatial Association*, to indicate, where required, that
the horizontal position and/or the vertical uncertainty for the
sounding(s) is of different (higher or lower) accuracy than indicated
by the underlying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* Meta feature (see
<<sec_3.8>>). See also <<sec_3.8.1.3>>(Sounding uncertainty).
* Where a named isolated shoal is indicated in the dataset by a
single encoded sounding, the name of the shoal must be encoded, where
required, using the complex attribute *feature name* on the
*Sounding* feature. Where the named isolated shoal is indicated by
two or more soundings (and possibly other submerged features), the
name of the shoal must be encoded, where required, using a *Sea
Area/Named Water Area* feature (see <<sec_2.5.8;and!sec_9.1>>).
* Encoders must exercise caution when using the option to group
soundings; particularly where they are included in an ENC Update as
this may impact negatively on ECDIS performance regarding Mariner
interrogation of Updates. When grouping soundings in an ENC dataset,
creation of excessively large sounding groups should be avoided so as
to reduce the impact when a sounding is to be removed by ENC Update;
and new soundings to be added by ENC Update should not be added to
already existing sounding groups.
* For depths indicated as no bottom found, see <<sec_11.8>>.

==== Dredged areas (see S-4 -- B-414)

If it is required to encode dredged areas, this must be done using
the feature *Dredged Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The attribute *depth range minimum value* must be used to encode
the dredged depth for the dredged area. Where required, the attribute
*depth range maximum depth* must be used to encode the deeper depth
where a range of depths for the dredged area is indicated on the
source.
* The boundary of a dredged area should not have coincident curve geo
features encoded, unless part of the boundary corresponds to the
shoreline (see <<sec_5.3.1>>).
* Dredged areas are often subject to siltation, resulting in shoaler
depths being identified in the dredged area than the designed dredged
depth. Where required, the shoal depths should be encoded using
*Sounding*, with the appropriate underlying depth information (*Depth
Area* and, if required, *Depth Contour*) to support the depths.
Alternatively, the attribute *depth range maximum value* for the
*Dredged Area* may be set to the designed dredged depth for the
dredged area, and the attribute *depth range minimum value* set to
the value of the shoalest depth, or a *Caution Area* feature may be
encoded covering the shoaler depth area with the depth information
provided using the complex attribute *information* (see
<<sec_2.4.6>>). Where the shoal depths are close to the edge of the
dredged area, the dredged area limit may be adjusted to exclude the
shoal depths from the surface. See also S-4 -- B-414.5.
* The attribute *source date* may be used to encode the year of the
latest control survey for dredged areas where the dredged depth is
not maintained. For dredged areas where the dredged depth is
maintained, it is not required to indicate the year of dredging.
* Where the complex attribute *vertical uncertainty* is populated for
a *Dredged Area* feature, it must not be equivalent to or degrade the
uncertainty indicated by the complex attribute *vertical uncertainty*
for the underlying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* Meta feature (see
<<sec_3.8;and!sec_24.5>>).
* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed
limits, see <<sec_17.4>>.

==== Swept areas (see S-4 -- B-415)

If it is required to encode a swept area, it must be done using the
feature *Swept Area*.

Spot soundings and depth contours shown in these areas must be
encoded using *Sounding* and *Depth Contour* features. A Meta feature
*Quality of Bathymetric Data* must be encoded to provide quality
information for the *Swept Area* (see <<sec_3.8>>). The *depth range
maximum* value for the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature must be
equal to the swept depth (*depth range minimum*) value for the *Swept
Area*. The complex attribute *vertical uncertainty* (*uncertainty
fixed*) may be used on the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* or on the
associated *Spatial Quality* feature (see <<sec_24.5>>) to specify
the uncertainty of the swept depth value, or otherwise must be
populated as _0_; *horizontal position uncertainty* (*uncertainty
fixed*) on the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* or on the associated
*Spatial Quality* must be populated as _0_. Where required, a
separate *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature must be encoded to
provide depth or positional accuracy information for any underlying
bathymetry within the swept area.

[[fig_11-1]]
.Swept areas -- Quality of bathymetric data
image::figure-11-1.png["",657,402]

Even if the area contains no spot soundings or depth contours, a
*Swept Area* feature must overlap *Depth Area* or *Dredged Area*
features. If there is insufficient depth information to allow the
attributes *depth range minimum value* and *depth range maximum
value* to be encoded on a *Depth Area* or *Dredged Area* feature,
*depth range minimum value* should be set to the swept depth and
*depth range maximum value* should be set to an empty (null) value.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The attribute *depth range minimum value* must be used to encode
the swept depth for the swept area.
* Where required, the date of sweeping must be populated using the

==== Depth contours (see S-4 -- B-404.2; B-410; B-411 to B-411.5; B-413 and B-413.1)

The standard series of depth contour lines to be encoded for ENC is:
drying line (0 contour -- where tides are appreciable), 2, 5, 10, 15,
20, 30, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 2000 metres, etc. The 2, 5
and/or 15 metre contours may be omitted where they serve no useful
purpose, and on smaller optimum display scale ENC data all depth
contours to 30 metres (1:1500000 and 1:3000000 optimum display
scales) or 200 metres (1:10000000 optimum display scale) should be
omitted. It is not necessary for the complete sequence of contours to
be shown, for example on steep slopes and around isolated pinnacles.

Supplementary contours, for example at 3, 8, 25, 40, 75 metres and
multiples of 10 or 100 metres may be shown, if the available data
permit, to delineate particular bathymetric features where soundings
would otherwise be the only depth information over a large area, or
for the benefit of particular categories of shipping. The 2500 metre
contour may be required for measuring Continental Shelf limits (see
UNCLOS Article 76).

On the larger optimum display scale ENC datasets, for example
datasets intended for harbour navigation or berthing; or in areas
where vessel under keel clearance is critical, a smaller contour
interval may be used (for example 1 metre, or 0.1 metre if it is
desired to provide the same depth accuracy as for soundings) in the
depth range suitable for the deepest draught vessels that may
navigate in the area. Such encoding is intended to best utilize the
safety depth indication functionality of the ECDIS.

The boundary of a drying rocky area (see INT1 - J20) or coral reef
(see INT1 - J22) may be coincident with the zero metre contour (see
'_fg_' in the Figure). If it is required to encode this boundary, it
must be done using the feature *Depth Contour* with the attribute
stem:[bb "value of depth contour" = 0].

On the source, the presentation of contours in areas of steep slope
is sometimes generalised so that closely spaced contours are removed
to leave a single contour (see '_ab_' in Figure). In such cases, this
contour must be encoded using the shallowest depth of the slope.

Wherever possible, contours must be closed, or connected to the
border of the dataset, a coastline feature or another contour, in
order to define closed areas.

Spatial quality associated with contours may be encoded using the
*Spatial Quality* information type, attribute *quality of horizontal
measurement* (see <<sec_28.14>>). This should only be encoded if the
spatial quality of the contour(s) is different to that indicated for
the overall quality of the bathymetric data in the area as described
for the underlying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* Meta feature (see
<<sec_3.8>>). However, in order to provide an additional indication
to the mariner of areas of lower reliability bathymetric data,
contours in depths of 30 metres or less may have the attribute
*quality of horizontal measurement* on the associated *Spatial
Quality* information type populated with value _4_ (approximate).

[[sec_11.7.1]]
==== Depth areas (see S-4 -- B-410)

The sea area, the intertidal area and the navigable parts of rivers,
lakes and canals must be divided into depth areas, each of them
having a range of depth.

As many depth areas as possible must be created using encoded depth
contours.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The value of *depth range maximum value* for the deepest *Depth
Area* on the ENC dataset should be encoded with the next deepest
depth contour from the standard range of depth contours appropriate
to the optimum display scale of the ENC data (see <<sec_11.6.1>>),
noting that the depth ranges used for adjoining ENC datasets of the
same or similar optimum display scale must also be considered.
* *Depth Area* features are part of the Skin of the Earth.

[[sec_11.7.2]]
==== Geometry of depth areas

Where surfaces are not closed on the source, it may be necessary to
close these surfaces using edges without associated curve features.
This is mandatory at the boundary of a dataset (see <<fig_11-3>>
below).

In <<fig_11-3>> below, the annotation "**min**" equates to the
attribute *depth range minimum value* and the annotation "**max**"
equates to the attribute *depth range maximum value*.

[[fig_11-3]]
.Geometry of depth areas
image::figure-11-3.png[545,204]

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For short isolated sections of *Depth Contour* features such as
(_fi_), it is up to the producing authority whether to encode the
small areas (_efije_ and _fghif_) as separate *Depth Area* features,
or to encode only the curve (_fi_) as a floating *Depth Contour*
feature within a single *Depth Area* (_abcda_) having attributes
stem:[bb "depth range minimum value" = 5] and stem:[bb "depth range
maximum value" = 20].

NOTE: In <<fig_11-3>>, if the optional *Depth Area* features are
encoded, the depth area (_abcda_) will be split into two separate
*Depth Area* features (_abgea_) and (_jhcdj_), both having stem:[bb
"depth range minimum value" = 5] and stem:[bb "depth range maximum
value" = 20].

[[sec_11.7.3]]
==== Use of attributes depth range minimum value and depth range maximum value for depth areas in general

For each depth area, *depth range minimum value* and *depth range
maximum value* should be encoded with the values corresponding to the
shallowest and deepest depths in that area. These values, except for
the shallowest and deepest areas, should be chosen from the values of
the depth contours encoded in the dataset, however the values for
isolated shallow or deep areas may be taken from the shallowest or
deepest measured depth (see items 2 and 3 in <<fig_11-4>> below).

A drying area, within which a drying height is indicated without a
true position, should be encoded using a *Depth Area* feature, with
*depth range minimum value* set to the value of the drying height and
*depth range maximum value* set to a dataset contour value (usually
zero). Alternatively, *depth range minimum value* for the *Depth
Area* may be set to --H (see NOTE (a) associated with <<fig_11-4>>
below for definition of H), with the drying height encoded using the
complex attribute *information* (see <<sec_2.4.6>>), sub-attribute
*text*(for example_Dries 1.4_).

If a depth area is adjacent to a non-navigable waterway, a closing
curve (that is, no curve geo feature) should be encoded at the
boundary between navigable and non-navigable waters. See
<<sec_11.7.4>>.

In <<fig_11-4>> below, the annotation "**min**" equates to the
attribute *depth range minimum value* and the annotation "**max**"
equates to the attribute *depth range maximum value*.

[[fig_11-4]]
.Depth areas
image::figure-11-4.png[454,442]

**NOTE (a)**: H = Height of the coastline datum above sounding datum,
or a rounded value (for example (1) the value of the highest drying
contour indicated on the source document; or (2) zero, if the
coastline datum is the same as the sounding datum).

In the following clauses, the paragraph numbers refer to the item
numbers in <<fig_11-4>>. These clauses do not cover all encoding
scenarios.

. If the depth area is bounded by two or more depth contours:
+
--
* *depth range minimum value* should take the value of the dataset
depth contour immediately shallower than the value of *depth range
maximum value*.
* *depth range maximum value* should take the value of the deepest
depth contour bounding the area.
--

. If the depth area is only bounded by one depth contour andthe
deepest depth is shown by a depth contour, and the shallowest depth
is shown by a sounding (an isolated shoal area):
+
--
* *depth range minimum value* should take the value of the dataset
depth contour immediately shallower than the value of the sounding or
‑H. However if the shallowest sounding within the area is considered
to be the least depth of the shoal, *depth range minimum value* may
be populated with the value of this sounding.
* *depth range maximum value* should take the value of the depth
contour.

NOTE: In the case where the shallowest depth in the area is equal to
the bounding depth contour, both *depth range minimum value* and
*depth range maximum value* may be populated with the value of the
depth contour.
--

. If the depth area is only bounded by one depth contour andthe
deepest depth is shown by a sounding and the shallowest depth is
shown by a depth contour (an isolated deep area):
+
--
* *depth range minimum value* should take the value of the depth
contour.
* *depth range maximum value* should take the value of the dataset
depth contour immediately deeper than or equal to the value of the
sounding. However if the deepest sounding within the area is
considered to be the deepest depth of the deep, *depth range maximum
value* may be populated with the value of this sounding.
--

. If the shallowest depth is defined by the coastline:
+
--
* *depth range minimum value* should take the value of -H.
* *depth range maximum value* should take the value of the shallowest
dataset depth contour bounding the area.
--

. If the depth area is bounded by only one depth contour, contains no
soundings, and is a shoal:
+
--
* *depth range minimum value* should take the value of the dataset
depth contour immediately shallower than the value of the depth
contour, or -H.
* *depth range maximum value* should take the value of the depth
contour.
--

. If the depth area is bounded by only one depth contour, contains no
soundings, and is a deep:
+
--
* *depth range minimum value* should take the value of the depth
contour.
* *depth range maximum value* should take the value of the standard
depth contour immediately deeper than the value of the depth contour.
--

. If the depth area is bounded by an incomplete depth contour on one
side (such as in incompletely surveyed area), and a complete depth
contour on the other:
+
--
* These areas are optional. See <<sec_11.7.2>> above and associated
<<fig_11-3>>.
--

. If the depth area is bounded by complete depth contours, but
contains an incomplete (floating) depth contour:
+
--
* *depth range minimum value* should take the value of the shallowest
depth contour.
* *depth range maximum value* should take the value of the deepest
depth contour.

NOTE: Where the optional depth areas in paragraph 7 above are
encoded, this will result in two discrete *Depth Area* features, one
on each side of the encoded optional depth areas. See <<sec_11.7.2>>
above and associated <<fig_11-3>>.
--

[[sec_11.7.4]]
==== Rivers, canals, lakes, basins, locks

Where these areas are navigable at the optimum display scale for the
ENC data, they must be encoded using the Skin of the Earth features
*Depth Area*, *Dredged Area* or *Unsurveyed Area*, and coastline-type
features *Coastline* or *Shoreline Construction*. If it is required
to encode the nature and name of the area, it must be done using the
feature *Sea Area/Named Water Area*.

Where these areas are required and are not navigable at the optimum
display scale for the ENC data, they must be encoded using the
features *River*, *Canal* or *Lake*. These features must be covered
by *Land Area* features.

[[sec_11.7.5]]
==== Areas of continual change (see S-4 -- B-416)

If it is required to encode an area of continually changing
bathymetry, it must be done by populating the attribute stem:[bb
"category of temporal variation" = 2] (likely to change and
significant shoaling expected) or _3_ (likely to change but
significant shoaling not expected) for the underlying *Quality of
Bathymetric Data* feature (see <<sec_3.8>>).

Such areas must always overlap *Depth Area* features.

An area on the source with the indication "Less water" should be
encoded using the feature *Caution Area* (see <<sec_16.10>>). Caution
notes in such areas must be encoded using the complex attribute
*information* (see <<sec_2.4.6>>).

If it is required to encode sandwaves, this must be done using the
feature *Sandwave* (see <<sec_12.4>>).

==== No bottom found depths (see S-4 -- B-412.3)

If it is required to encode a depth at a point at which it is
indicated as having no bottom found at the value shown, it must be
done using the feature *Depth -- No Bottom Found*.

The geometry of soundings (see <<sec_11.3.1>>) and no bottom found
depths is held in a 3-dimensional array (latitude, longitude, depth).
In the interests of efficiency, multiple no bottom found depths
should be encoded in one spatial type, provided that all the spatial
and geo feature attributes are common to the group and all no bottom
found depths in the group are related to the same sounding datum (see
<<sec_3.9>>).

Even though the sounding multiplication factor (CMFZ) for ENC is
{10}, no bottom found depths must be encoded to a whole metre value.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For encoding areas that have been systematically surveyed and for
which the depth has not been found (for example, for LIDAR surveys),
see <<sec_11.5.1>>.

[[sec_11.9]]
=== Areas with inadequate depth information

[[sec_11.9.1]]
==== Inadequately surveyed areas (see S-4 -- B-417)

Inadequately surveyed areasmay be defined as those areas where
bathymetry is based on older lead line surveys or other surveys which
are either open in nature (for example reconnaissance surveys), or
are not hydrographic surveys (for example seismic surveys). These
types of surveys are inadequate for identifying all shoals that may
exist between lines of soundings, or may not be "shoal-biased" in
their selection of recorded depths.

An inadequately surveyed area should be encoded using either an
*Unsurveyed Area* feature, within which soundings and contours may be
encoded (but not depth areas), or using *Depth Area* features. The
attributes *depth range minimum value* and *depth range maximum
value* for such depth areas should have explicit values.

The area must also be covered by *Quality of Bathymetric Data*
features (see <<sec_3.8>>), having appropriate attribute values,
usually stem:[bb "category of temporal variation" = 6] (unassessed),
*features detected* (*significant features detected*) = _False_, and
*full seafloor coverage achieved* = _False_. Further information may
be given using the Meta feature *Quality of Survey* (see
<<sec_3.11>>), where appropriate.

A cautionary note should also be encoded using a *Caution Area*
feature of type surface (see <<sec_16.11>>), complex attribute
*information* (see <<sec_2.4.6>>).

[[sec_11.9.2]]
==== Bathymetry in areas of minimal depiction of detail on paper charts

Where areas of little or no depth information exist within a
specified ENC usage, they should be encoded using one of the
following options:

[[sec_11.9.2.1]]
===== Areas of omitted bathymetry

Encoders are advised that when encoding areas of bathymetry from
paper charts containing minimal depth detail at scales that
correspond to the optimum display scale for the data, to consult
larger scale paper charts or optimum display scale ENC datasets and
generalise the bathymetry from this data. This is done to ensure that
sufficient information is encoded so as not to conflict with larger
optimum display scale coverage. The following is the recommended
minimum encoding requirement in such cases:

Where larger optimum display scale ENC coverage is available, the
larger scale datasets should be examined to determine the shallowest
*Depth Area* feature, other than the intertidal area, within the
whole of the area. Intertidal areas should then be generalised from
the larger optimum display scale coverage, and one *Depth Area*
feature may then be created, with attributes *depth range minimum
value* and *depth range maximum value* encoded from the values
obtained from the larger scale, corresponding to the remaining area
of bathymetry.

Where larger optimum display scale coverage does not exist, a single
*Depth Area* feature may be created to cover the area of omitted
bathymetry. The *depth range minimum value* of the *Depth Area*
feature should be set to the shallowest value appropriate to the
colour tint that is applied to it (for example if blue tint is used
for 5-20m areas, the *depth range minimum value* for the area of
omitted bathymetry should be set to _5_). The *depth range maximum
value* should be set to the shallowest value of the surrounding Skin
of the Earth polygons.

In either case, the areas should be covered by a *Caution Area*
feature, the boundary of which follows exactly the surrounding Skin
of the Earth features (see <<sec_2.5.3.2>>).

Encoders should consider the effect of over-generalising areas of
omitted bathymetry on the ECDIS display as the Mariner "zooms out"
through the ENC display scales.

[[sec_11.9.2.2]]
===== Areas of very simplified bathymetry

In these areas, information relating to bathymetry (for example depth
contours, dangers, rocky areas, isolated rocks, nature of the seabed,
dredged areas, unsurveyed areas) should be individually encoded as
normal.

A *Caution Area* feature (see <<sec_16.11>>) should be created
covering the *Depth Area* features within the area of simplified
bathymetry, with a cautionary note encoded using the complex
attribute *information* (see <<sec_2.4.6>>).

[[sec_11.9.3]]
==== Depth discontinuities between surveys (see S-4 -- B-416.1)

Depth discontinuities between adjoining or overlapping source
bathymetric surveys may be caused by:

* Surveys in areas of continually changing depth (see <<sec_11.7.5>>)
conducted with a significant time gap between the surveys; or
* Adjoining areas having significant differences in the quality of
bathymetric data (see <<sec_3.8>>).

It may not be possible to safely resolve significant depth
discontinuity by interpolating approximate depth contours, which may
compromise the ability for the compiler to adequately encode
complete, non-overlapping Skin of the Earth coverage of the area of
the ENC cell covered by data. Where it is required to indicate these
significant depth discontinuities, it should be done by encoding a
"very narrow" *Unsurveyed Area* feature.

The "very narrow area" should be at least 0.3mm in width at optimum
display scale for the ENC data.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* An indication of the purpose of the *Unsurveyed Area* may be done
by population of the complex attribute *information* (see
<<sec_2.4.6>>), sub-attribute *text*, for example _Discontinuity
between surveys_.
* In order to provide an indication to the Mariner of the more
reliable encoded bathymetry in an area of continually changing depth,
the defining attributes should be downgraded for the *Quality of
Bathymetric Data* feature (see <<sec_3.8>>) corresponding to the less
reliable (or older) data.

[[sec_11.9.4]]
==== Satellite imagery as source information

In some areas source information may be limited to shallow water
depth information derived from satellite imagery. Where defined
depths can be interpolated from satellite imagery (for example the
drying line, 5 metre or 10 metre depth contours), and little or no
reliable source survey information exists in the area, consideration
should be given to showing this information in ENCs.

If it is required to encode shoal areas which have been derived from
satellite imagery, *Depth Area* and *Depth Contour* features of an
appropriate depth range should be used. This should only be done in
areas which have not been systematically surveyed. Areas of depth
information derived from satellite imagery must be covered by
*Quality of Bathymetric Data* Meta features (see <<sec_3.8>>).
Recommended attribute values for the *Quality of Bathymetric Data*
include stem:[bb "category of temporal variation" = 6] (unassessed);
*features detected* (*significant features detected*) = _False_; and
*full seafloor coverage achieved* = _False_. Optionally, the area may
also be covered by a *Quality of Survey* feature (see <<sec_3.11>>),
having attribute stem:[bb "technique of vertical measurement" = 11]
(satellite imagery).

In some cases satellite imagery provides evidence that existing
charted information derived from source survey data has changed over
time. If required, the attribute *category of temporal variation* on
the underlying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* Meta feature should be
amended to _2_ (likely to change and significant shoaling expected)
or _3_ (likely to change but significant shoaling not expected).
Alternatively, if the quality of the charted bathymetry is considered
by the Producing Authority to be poor, consideration may be given to
replacing the existing charted detail using the satellite derived
data, as described above, however with stem:[bb "category of temporal
variation" = 2] (likely to change and significant shoaling expected)
or _3_ (likely to change but significant shoaling not expected).

may include areas which only have lines of passage soundings and/or
other miscellaneous data such as isolated ship's reports.

Areas with little or no bathymetric survey information must be

_False_ and *full seafloor coverage achieved* = _False_; and (if
encoded on *Quality of Bathymetric Data*)*horizontal position
