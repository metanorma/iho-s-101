== Metadata Features

The maximum use must be made of Meta features to reduce the attribution on individual features. In a Base dataset (see S-101 Annex B, clauseB5), some Meta features are mandatory.

These mandatory Meta features are in the following list:

*Data Coverage:* In order to assist in data discovery, the Meta feature *Data Coverage* must be used to provide coverage of the part of the dataset covered by Skin of the Earth features. See <<sec_3.5>>.

*Navigational System of Marks:* The Meta feature *Navigational System of Marks* must provide an exhaustive non-overlapping coverage of the *Data Coverage* feature(s). See <<sec_3.6>>.

*Quality of Bathymetric Data:* The Meta feature *Quality of Bathymetric Data* defines areas within which uniform assessment exists for the quality of bathymetric data, and is used to provide an assessment of the overall quality of bathymetric data to the Mariner. Areas of a dataset at optimum display scale 1:700000 and larger containing depth data or bathymetry must be covered by one or more *Quality of Bathymetric Data* features, which may overlap vertically (see <<sec_3.8.1>>). At optimum display scales smaller than 1:700000, *Quality of Bathymetric Data* features are optional.

NOTE: Where a dataset does not contain any depth data or bathymetry, it is not required to encode *Quality of Bathymetric Data*.

*Sounding Datum:* The Meta feature *Sounding Datum* must provide an exhaustive non-overlapping coverage of the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature(s). See <<sec_3.9>>.

NOTE: Where a dataset does not contain any depth data or bathymetry, it is not required to encode *Sounding Datum*.

*Vertical Datum of Data:* The Meta feature *Vertical Datum of Data* must provide an exhaustive non-overlapping coverage of the *Data Coverage* feature(s). See <<sec_3.10>>.

[[sec_3.1]]
=== Horizontal uncertainty

The attributes *quality of horizontal measurement* and *horizontal position uncertainty* may be applied to any spatial type, in order to qualify the location of a feature.

If it is required to encode the uncertainty of a horizontal clearance (complex attributes *horizontal clearance fixed* and *horizontal clearance open*), it must be done using the sub-attribute *horizontal distance uncertainty*.

*horizontal distance uncertainty* applies only to *horizontal clearance fixed* and *horizontal clearance open*. There is no attribute to express the accuracy of the attributes *horizontal length* and *horizontal width*.

*horizontal distance uncertainty* and *quality of horizontal measurement* must not be applied to the spatial type of any geo feature if they are identical to the *horizontal distance uncertainty* and *quality of horizontal measurement* values of the underlying Meta feature. *horizontal position uncertainty* must not be applied to the spatial type of any geo feature if it is identical to the *horizontal position uncertainty* value(s) of the underlying Meta feature, except for *Sounding* and *Underwater/Awash Rock* features; and *Foul Ground*, *Marine Farm/Culture*, *Obstruction* and *Wreck* features of type point (see clauses 3.8.1.3, 11.3, 13.4-7 and 13.10).

*quality of horizontal measurement* gives qualitative information, whereas *horizontal position uncertainty* gives quantitative information.

[underline]#Remarks:#

No remarks.

[[sec_3.2]]
=== Vertical uncertainty

If it is required to encode the uncertainty of a vertical clearance (complex attributes *vertical**clearance fixed*, *vertical clearance open*, *vertical clearance closed* and *vertical clearance safe*), it must be done using the complex sub-attribute *vertical uncertainty* (see <<sec_29.40>>).

If several vertical clearances are given for one feature, the uncertainty given must be that of the least accurate.

[underline]#Remarks:#

No remarks.

|===

\* The information type *Spatial Quality*, attributes *horizontal position uncertainty* and *vertical uncertainty*, may be associated to *Quality of Bathymetric Data* using the information to feature association *Quality of Bathymetric Data Composition* (see <<sec_25.12>>).

\*\* As populated on an associated instance of the information type *Spatial Quality*, using the information to feature association *Spatial Association* (see <<sec_25.15>>).

Features and attributes shown in grey text in <<table_3-1>> above do not play an active role in regard to ECDIS display and/or performance in terms of hierarchy of the encoding. However, where both the S-101 Meta feature and the attribute for the Geo feature are encoded, end-user interpretation of the ECDIS Pick Report is that the value populated for the attribute on the Geo feature provides the relevant value.

It is prohibited to use an attribute on an individual object, if this attribute has the same value as the general value defined by the Meta feature.

==== Coverage

The Meta feature *Data Coverage* encodes the area covered by data within the dataset. This feature is also used to provide the ECDIS with the scale information necessary for the determination of dataset loading and rendering (display) in relation to the user selected viewing scale in the ECDIS. There must be a minimum of one *Data Coverage* feature in the dataset. *Data Coverage* features must cover the equivalent area to the extent of the spatial types in the dataset, and must not overlap (see <<sec_2.5.1>>).

Where populated, all *Data Coverage* features in the dataset must have the same value for the attribute *drawing index*, as datasets that share a common drawing index are intended to form a seamless presentation, regardless of the populated value(s) for minimum display scale. *Data Coverage* features which share a common drawing index must not overlap.

The mandatory attribute *optimum display scale* is used to indicate the intended viewing scale for the data. The value populated for *optimum display scale*, therefore, provides a reference for the user selected viewing scale in the ECDIS at which the overscale warning will be displayed as the Mariner continues to zoom in if there is no larger optimum display scale ENC dataset available.

The mandatory attribute *minimum display scale* is used to indicate the smallest intended viewing scale for the data where a full portfolio of ENCs is available; and provides the reference scale that defines a "series" of ENCs covering a geographic area intended to be displayed seamlessly. Where an empty (null) value is populated for *minimum display scale*, the ECDIS will continue to display the data regardless of how small the user selected viewing scale becomes. The value populated for *minimum display scale*, therefore, is intended to be used in a series of ENC cells covering a geographic area to determine the dataset rendering (display) priority as the user selected viewing scale becomes larger.

The mandatory attribute *maximum display scale* is used to indicate the scale at which the Data Producer considers that the "grossly overscaled" warning is to be triggered based on the user selected viewing scale.

For ENC, in order to provide a consistent relationship between the encoded data and the way the data is displayed in ECDIS, the values for *maximum display scale*, *minimum display scale* and *optimum display scale* must be taken from the values listed in the following Table:

[[table_3-2]]
.Maximum, optimum and minimum display scale values
[cols="980,938,931"]
|===
h| maximum display scale h| optimum display scale h| minimum display scale
.15+^.^| Any value

| 3,500,000     | 10,000,000
| 1,500,000     | 3,500,000
| 700,000       | 1,500,000
| 350,000       | 700,000
| 180,000       | 350,000
| 90,000        | 180,000
| 45,000        | 90,000
| 22,000        | 45,000
| 12,000        | 22,000
| 8,000         | 12,000
| 4,000         | 8,000
| 3,000         | 4,000
| 2,000         | 3,000
| 1,000         | 2,000
|===

NOTE: The selection of values for *maximum display scale* and *minimum display scale* for any selected *optimum display scale* are at the discretion of the Data Producer. That is, any value listed for *maximum display scale* and *minimum display scale* above may be selected from any of the listed values, with the only restriction being that *maximum display scale* must be a smaller value than/equal to *optimum display scale* which must be a smaller value than *minimum display scale* (or any value if *minimum display scale* is populated with an empty (null) value).

Typically, only a single *Data Coverage* feature should be used in a dataset. However, if the optimum display scale is different for discrete areas within a single ENC dataset, this must be indicated by encoding separate, non-overlapping *Data Coverage* features, each having a different value populated for *optimum display scale*. Producing Authorities are to note, however, that excessive use of multiple *Data Coverage* features having different values of *optimum display scale* within a single dataset should be avoided. Where different values of *optimum display scale* are used, this should be restricted only to data compiled in order to achieve the intended navigational usage for the entire dataset. Datasets must have the same value for *minimum display scale* for all *Data Coverage* features in the dataset. Datasets may have different values populated for *maximum display scale* for the *Data Coverage* features in the dataset; these values are typically populated as the value corresponding to 2 x the scale (or half the denominator) value populated for *optimum display scale* (this will replicate the corresponding gross overscale indication as implemented in S-57/S-52), but are at the discretion of the Data Producer. For example, the value for *maximum display scale* may be set to the same value as *optimum display scale* to have the "grossly overscaled" warning appear at any larger user selected viewing scale than *optimum display scale*; or populated as the value corresponding to the *minimum display scale* value for the next largest scale dataset(s) in the ENC portfolio.

Where a series of differing optimum display scale ENC datasets are compiled covering the same geographic area, the smallest scale value populated for *optimum display scale* for *Data Coverage* feature(s) in the dataset should correspond to the *minimum display scale*, where populated, for the next largest optimum display scale ENC dataset. The largest scale value populated for *optimum display scale* for *Data Coverage* feature(s) in the dataset must not be a larger scale value than the *optimum display scale* for the next largest optimum display scale ENC dataset, where such a dataset exists.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* This Meta feature is intended to support an indication of coverage; and facilitates the loading and rendering (display) of datasets in the end-user system.
* Where more than one *Data Coverage* feature exists for a dataset, the dataset, when initially loaded, will be displayed in the ECDIS at a display scale corresponding to the largest scale value populated for *optimum display scale*.
* Where a dataset consists of only one *Data Coverage* feature, the value for the optimum display scale populated in the dataset discovery metadata must be the same as the value populated for *optimum display scale* on the *Data Coverage*.
* Except for the largest scale dataset coverage, datasets with multiple *Data Coverage* features must not have excessive differences in the values populated for *optimum display scale* between the *Data Coverage* features. Typically, this should be interpreted as there being no more than one scale step value as defined in <<table_3-2>> above between the *optimum display scale* values in a single dataset.

==== Quality, reliability and uncertainty of bathymetric data (see S-4 -- B-297)

Information about quality, reliability and uncertainty of bathymetric data is given using:

* the Meta feature *Quality of Bathymetric Data* and, if required, an associated instance of the Information type *Spatial Quality* (see <<sec_24.5>>) for an overall assessment of the quality of bathymetric data;
* the Meta feature *Quality of Survey* for additional information about individual surveys (see <<sec_3.11>>);
* the attributes *quality of vertical measurement* and *technique of vertical measurement* on groups of soundings or individual features;
* the attributes *horizontal* *position uncertainty*, *quality of horizontal measurement* and *vertical uncertainty* on the spatial types (see clauses 2.4.7 and 24.5).
Bathymetric data quality comprises the following:

** completeness of data (for example, seafloor coverage);
** currency of data (for example, temporal degradation);
** uncertainty of data;
** source of data.

For the Mariner, *Quality of Bathymetric Data* provides the most useful information. Therefore, the use of *Quality of Bathymetric Data* is mandatory for areas containing depth data or bathymetry on ENC datasets at optimum display scale 1:700000 and larger.

In order to provide an indication of the horizontal position and vertical accuracies of the features to which it applies, instances of *Quality of Bathymetric Data* must have the sub-complex attributes *horizontal position uncertainty* and *vertical uncertainty* populated on *Quality of Bathymetric Data*, or alternately on an associated instance of the information type *Spatial Quality* (see <<sec_24.5>>), using the association *Quality of Bathymetric Data Composition* (see <<sec_25.12>>).

More detailed information about a survey may be given using *Quality of Survey* (see <<sec_3.11>>). For example, in incompletely surveyed areas, lines of passage soundings may be indicated as such using a curve *Quality of Survey* feature. This information is more difficult for the Mariner to interpret, therefore the use of *Quality of Survey* is optional.

For individual features (wrecks, obstructions etc), or individual/small groups of soundings, *quality of vertical measurement*, *technique of vertical measurement*, *horizontal position uncertainty* and *vertical uncertainty* may be used to provide additional information about quality and uncertainty.

The Meta feature *Quality of Bathymetric Data* defines areas within which uniform assessment exists for the quality of bathymetric data, and must be used, where required, to provide an assessment of the overall quality of bathymetric data to the Mariner. Therefore, areas of a dataset containing depth data or bathymetry at optimum display scale 1:700000 and larger must be covered by one or more *Quality of Bathymetric Data*, which may overlap vertically in order to define the quality of bathymetric data at varying depths in the water column.

[[fig_3-2]]
.Adjoining and overlapping Quality of Bathymetric Data features
image::figure-3-2.png["",657,402]

<<fig_3-2>> above demonstrates the encoding for varying quality of bathymetric data in the water column, in this example a mechanically swept area to a depth of 5 metres that has also been previously surveyed using single beam echo sounder to the seabed. For the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature that defines the data quality for the swept area, it is important to note that the recommended attribution shown above is intended to provide the highest (best) quality indicator for vessels navigating at a safety depth of less than 5 metres in the area. For vessels navigating at a safety depth of greater than 5 metres in the area, or at any depth outside the area, the lower quality indicator will be provided.

NOTE: <<fig_3-2>> demonstrates the two options for the encoding of the horizontal position and vertical uncertainties available in S-101. For the area covered by the swept area, the varying horizontal position and vertical uncertainties in the water column are encoded using the sub-complex attributes *horizontal position uncertainty* and *vertical uncertainty* on the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* features. For the two areas covered only by the single beam echo sounder survey to the seabed, the horizontal position and vertical uncertainties are encoded using the sub-complex attributes *horizontal position uncertainty* and *vertical uncertainty* on an associated *Spatial Quality* feature (which may be a single *Spatial Quality* feature associated to both *Quality of Bathymetric Data* features). See the Remarks below and <<sec_24.5>>.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The mandatory attribute *data assessment* provides an overall indicative level of assessment of bathymetric data from which further attribution is derived, and assists with portrayal of bathymetric data quality information in ECDIS:

** Where the value for *data assessment* is set to _1_ (assessed), all additional attribution for the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature must be indicative of the quality of bathymetric data for the area.
** Where the value for *data assessment* is set to _2_ (assessed (oceanic)), all additional attribution for the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature should be indicative of the quality of bathymetric data for the area for a Mariner's ECDIS pick report, however no portrayal of the quality information will display on the ECDIS. This value should only be used to cover open ocean (oceanic) depths in waters deeper than 200 metres.
** [[OLE_LINK11]][[OLE_LINK10]]Where the value for *data assessment* is set to _3_ (unassessed), the mandatory attributes *category of temporal variation* = _6_ (unassessed); *features detected* (*least depth of detected features measured* and *significant features detected*) = __False__; *full seafloor coverage achieved* = __False__; and *category of zone of confidence in data* = _6_ (zone of confidence U); and *horizontal position uncertainty* (*uncertainty fixed*) and *vertical uncertainty* (*uncertainty fixed*) on *Quality of Bathymetric Data* or the associated *Spatial Quality* = empty (null) must be populated.
* Wherever possible, meaningful and useful values for the attributes *category of temporal variation*, *full seafloor coverage achieved*, and the complex attribute *features detected* must be used for areas of bathymetry. For areas of unstable seafloors, the complex attribute *survey date range* (*date end*) should be used to indicate the date of the survey of the underlying bathymetric data.
* As a result of some disasters, for example earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, it is possible that large areas of seafloor have moved and/or become cluttered with dangerous obstructions. Emergency surveys may subsequently be conducted over essential shipping routes and inside harbours. Outside these surveys, all existing detail is now suspect, whatever the quality of the previous surveys. In such cases, the attribute *category of temporal variation* should be reclassified to value _1_ (extreme event), the Boolean attribute *full seafloor coverage achieved* set to __False__; complex attribute *features detected*, Boolean sub-attributes *least depth of detected features measured* and *significant features detected* set to __False__; the *zone of confidence* sub-attribute *category of zone of confidence in data* reclassified to _5_ (zone of confidence D); and the sub-attributes *horizontal position accuracy* (*uncertainty fixed*) and *vertical uncertainty* (*uncertainty fixed*) on *Quality of Bathymetric Data* or the associated *Spatial Quality*populated with an empty (null) value in the affected areas outside the area covered by emergency surveys.
* To express completeness of bathymetric data, the complex attribute *features detected* must be encoded. *features detected* indicates that a systematic method of exploring the seafloor, or the water column to the depth indicated by population of the attribute *depth range maximum value*, was undertaken to detect significant features. The sub-attributes *size of features detected* and *least depth of detected features measured* must not be encoded unless the sub-attribute *significant features detected* is set to _True_.
* The mandatory complex attribute *zone of confidence* is used on a *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature to provide an overall indication of the accuracy of the bathymetric data in the area; and may be used to specify the vertical and horizontal position uncertainty of the depths covered by the surface. Where *category of temporal variation* is set to values _2_ (likely to change and significant shoaling expected) or _3_ (likely to change but significant shoaling not expected), multiple instances of the complex attribute *zone of confidence* should be encoded to provide an indication of the degradation of the overall accuracy as well as the vertical and horizontal position uncertainty of the charted bathymetric information over time.

** Wherever possible, meaningful and useful values of the mandatory sub-attribute *category of zone of confidence in data* should be used (that is, values other than *category of zone of confidence in data* = _6_ (zone of confidence U)) for areas of bathymetry. These values must be determined from the *category of zone of confidence in data* definition table (see <<sec_27.74>>) in accordance with the values populated for the attribute *full seafloor coverage achieved*,the complex attribute *features detected* and the sub-complex attributes *horizontal position uncertainty* and *vertical uncertainty* on the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* or the associated *Spatial Quality* (see the following Remarks bullet).
** The sub-complex attribute *fixed date range* is used to define the date range(s) where the quality is degraded over time. Where multiple date ranges are specified, the *date start* of an instance must be equal to the *date end* of the previous instance. Within the sequence, the *date start* of the first instance and the *date end* of the last instance should not be populated; the values populated for *fixed date range* must not result in the removal of the indication of bathymetric data quality for an area from the Mariner.
* The sub-complex attributes *horizontal position uncertainty* and *vertical uncertainty* must be encoded using either *Quality of Bathymetric Data* or the Information feature *Spatial Quality* (see <<sec_24.5>>). The decision as to which option to use should be based on whether the horizontal position and vertical uncertainty values are specific to a single *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature or relates to multiple *Quality of Bathymetric Data* features. In general, specific values are related to areas of changeable bathymetry over time or varying bathymetric data quality in the water column (as shown in <<fig_3-2>> above); and repeating values are specific to general quality uncertainty values in non-changeable areas. It is prohibited to use both options for a single *Quality of Bathymetric Data* instance.

** *vertical uncertainty* on the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* or the associated *Spatial Quality* is used to specify the vertical uncertainty of the depths covered by the surface within a specified date range (where encoded); and should be adjusted to indicate the degradation of the vertical uncertainty over time where multiple instances of *zone of confidence* are encoded (see above bullet). When *depth range minimum value* is specified on *Quality of Bathymetric Data*, *vertical uncertainty* refers only to the uncertainty of the swept depth defined by *depth range minimum value*.
** *horizontal position uncertainty* on the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* or the associated *Spatial Quality* is used to specify the positional uncertainty of the depths covered by the surface within a specified date range (where encoded); and should be adjusted to indicate the degradation of the horizontal position uncertainty over time where multiple instances of *zone of confidence* are encoded (see above).
* *depth range minimum value* must only be used on a *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature where a swept area occupies the entire *Quality of Bathymetric Data* surface, or *Quality of Bathymetric Data* features overlap. Where these features overlap such that varying bathymetric data qualities exist at different depths in the water column, the *depth range minimum value* for a *Quality of Bathymetric Data* must be set to a value 0.1 metres deeper than the *depth range maximum value* for the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature defining the quality for the level above; and the topmost *Quality of Bathymetric Data* must have *depth range minimum value* set to an empty (null) value (see <<fig_3-2>> above).
* *depth range maximum value* must only be used on a *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature to specify the maximum depth to which all other attributes for the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature applies. When *depth range maximum value* is specified, values populated for all other attributes apply only to depths equal to or shoaler than *depth range maximum value*. No quality information is provided for depths deeper than *depth range maximum value*. Where *Quality of Bathymetric Data* features overlap such that varying bathymetric data qualities exist at different depths in the water column, the *depth range maximum value* for a *Quality of Bathymetric Data* must be set to a value 0.1 metres shoaler than the *depth range minimum value* for the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature defining the quality for the level below; and the bottommost *Quality of Bathymetric Data* must have *depth range maximum value* set to an empty (null) value (see <<fig_3-2>> above).
* *Quality of Bathymetric Data* must be encoded over *Unsurveyed Area* features that contain any depth data or bathymetry (depth contours, obstructions, soundings, underwater rocks, wrecks); and must have mandatory attributes *data assessment* = _1_ (assessed) *category of temporal variation* = _6_ (unassessed); *features detected* (*least depth of detected features measured* and *significant features detected*) = __False__; *full seafloor coverage achieved* = __False__; and *zone of confidence* (*category of zone of confidence in data*) = _5_ (zone of confidence D). The *vertical uncertainty* (*uncertainty fixed*) and *horizontal position uncertainty* (*uncertainty fixed*)for the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* or the associated *Spatial Quality* should be populated with an empty (null) value.
* For *Unsurveyed Area* features that do not contain any depth data or bathymetry, it is not required to encode a *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature that covers the area.

* If the attribute *technique of vertical measurement*is required, it must be encoded on either the Meta feature *Quality of Survey* (see <<sec_3.11>>) or on individual geo features (for example *Sounding*).

* When the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* surface contains data from only one survey, the date of survey should be specified using the complex attribute *survey date range*, sub-attribute *date end*. When the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* surface contains data from two or more surveys, the date of the most recent and the oldest survey should be specified using the complex attribute *survey date range*.
* *Quality of Bathymetric Data* areas must not be encoded over land.
* *Spatial Quality* (*horizontal position uncertainty*) associated to the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* using the association *Quality of Bathymetric Data Composition* (see <<sec_25.12>>), where encoded, applies to bathymetric data situated within the surface, while *Spatial Quality* (*quality of horizontal measurement*) or (*horizontal position uncertainty*) on the associated spatial types using the association *Spatial Association* (see <<sec_24.5>>) qualifies the location of the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature itself.
* Meta features *Quality of Bathymetric Data* and *Quality of Non-Bathymetric Data*may overlap.
* Additional quality information may be given using the Meta feature *Quality of Survey*.

[[sec_3.8.1.1]]
===== Temporal variation

The indication of degrading quality of bathymetry over time should be encoded using multiple instances of the complex attribute *zone of confidence* where required (see 5^th^ to 8^th^ bullet points in <<sec_3.8.1>> above).

The changeability of the bathymetry must be encoded using *category of temporal variation*. In order for a time reference to be given for the expression of temporal variation, the relevant dates of the bathymetric data should be encoded using the complex attribute *survey date range* if *category of temporal variation* is set to _1_ (extreme event), _2_ (likely to change and significant shoaling expected) or _3_ (likely to change but significant shoaling not expected). Consideration should be given, in particular, for the encoding of *survey data range* if multiple instances of *zone of confidence* are not encoded to provide an indication of the degradation of the overall accuracy of the charted bathymetric information over time, in order to provide the Mariner with a temporal frame of reference for decision making.

[[sec_3.8.1.2]]
===== Feature detection

In the context of bathymetry, a feature is any object, whether manmade or not, projecting above the seafloor, which may be considered a danger to surface navigation. Refer to IHO Publication S-44.

The ability to detect bathymetric features must be encoded using the complex attribute *features detected*. The sub-attribute *significant features detected* indicates whether the survey was capable of detecting features of a size indicated by the sub-attribute *size of features detected*. The sub-attribute *least depth of detected features measured* indicates whether the least depth of detected features was found. For instance, if a wreck was found, but it is not certain that the least depth of that wreck was measured, *least depth of detected features measured* must be set to _False_.

[[sec_3.8.1.3]]
===== Sounding uncertainty

Sounding uncertainty is encoded using the complex attribute *zone of confidence*, sub-complex attribute *vertical uncertainty* on **Quality of Bathymetric Data**; or alternatively using an associated instance of the information type *Spatial Quality*, complex attribute *spatial accuracy* (see <<sec_24.5>>) and using the association *Quality of Bathymetric Data Composition* (see <<sec_25.12>>). If it is required to encode additional sounding uncertainty information, it must be done using the attributes *quality of vertical measurement* and *technique of vertical measurement* on groups of soundings or individual features; or by associating another instance of the information type *Spatial Quality* to the spatial type associated with the individual geo features.

The vertical and horizontal position uncertainty values populated on the instance of *Quality of Bathymetric Data* or the associated *Spatial Quality* must reflect the most commonly associated values for the *Obstruction*, *Sounding*, *Underwater/Awash Rock* and *Wreck* features within the area.

==== Sounding datum

For depth information that is encoded using the attributes *value of sounding*, *depth range minimum value*, *depth range maximum value* and *value of depth contour* the sounding datum is encoded using the Meta feature *Sounding Datum*, and must be constant over large areas.

All parts of the dataset containing depth data or bathymetry must be covered by *Sounding Datum* features, with the attribute *vertical datum* indicating the sounding datum. *Sounding Datum* features must not overlap.

For sounding features (*Sounding* and *Depth -- No Bottom Found*) both the position and depth information is encoded by means of coordinates, with the depth information stored in the Z-coordinate. The sounding datum is defined by the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) for the Z-Coordinate ("Coordinate in Z Axis" [ZCOO] subfield of the "3-D Integer Coordinate Tuple" [C3IT] field or the "3-D Integer Coordinate List" [C3IL] field).

The definition of the CRS is stored in the "Dataset Coordinate Reference System" record and referred by the "Vertical CRS Id" [VCID] subfield of the "3-D Integer Coordinate Tuple" [C3IT] field or the "3-D Integer Coordinate List" [C3IL] field.

The CRS for the Z-coordinate should also have the subfield "Axis Type" [AXTY] of the corresponding "Coordinate System Axes" [CSAX] field set to _12_ (Gravity Related Depth).

Note, that because every ZCOO value is explicitly linked to sounding datum there is no default value.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The default sounding datum of the dataset must be encoded using the Meta feature *Sounding Datum*, and must be equivalent to the definition of the CRS as stored in the "Dataset Coordinate Reference System" record for the dataset.
* If an area of the dataset is referenced to a different sounding datum than the default, a separate *Sounding Datum* feature must be encoded. All parts of the dataset covered by *Quality of Bathymetric Data* features (see <<sec_3.8>>) must be covered by *Sounding Datum* features, with the attribute *vertical datum* indicating the sounding (depth) datum.
* The vertical CRS encoded in the Coordinate Reference System record fields for soundings is not utilized by the ECDIS in conveying the sounding datum information for an ENC to the Mariner in ECDIS. This information is provided instead using *Sounding Datum*. See also S-101 Product Specification Main document, <<sec_5.3>>.
* Sounding groups, depth contours and depth areas going across areas having different values of sounding datum must be split at the border of those areas. Other features that should be split include *Marine Farm/Culture*, *Obstruction* and *Wreck*, but only where the value of *value of sounding* is known; and *Berth*, *Cable Submarine*, *Deep Water Route Centreline*, *Deep Water Route Part*, *Dredged Area*, *Dry Dock*, *Fairway*, *Floating Dock*, *Gate*, *Pipeline Submarine/On Land*, *Recommended Route Centreline*, *Recommended Track*, *Swept Area*, *Two-Way Route Part* and *Quality of Bathymetric Data*, but only if the value of *depth range minimum value* and/or *depth range maximum value* is known.
* Meta features *Sounding Datum* and *Vertical Datum of Data*may overlap.

==== Vertical datum

Vertical (height) datum information is encoded using the Meta feature *Vertical Datum of Data*, or by populating the attribute *vertical datum* on individual geo features. The values encoded in the attributes *elevation*, *height*, *vertical clearance closed*, *vertical clearance fixed*, *vertical clearance open* and *vertical* **clearance safe** (positive values up) are referenced to the specified datum(s). *vertical datum* must not be encoded on any geo feature instance unless at least one of the above attributes is also encoded on that feature.

The vertical datum of the dataset must be encoded using the Meta feature *Vertical Datum of Data*:

All parts of the dataset containing data must be covered by *Vertical Datum of Data* features, with the attribute *vertical datum* indicating the vertical (height) datum. *Vertical Datum of Data* features must not overlap.

Various height datums may be used within an ENC. For example, different datums may be used for the following:

* altitude of spot heights, height contours, landmarks,
* elevation of lights,
* vertical clearance.

Where different vertical datums are used for the various vertical measurements, the default value given in the metadata for the *Vertical Datum of Data* applies to the first group of the above list. The attribute *vertical datum* on an individual feature applies to the elevation of lights and vertical clearances and must only be populated if different from the value given by *Vertical Datum of Data*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used for tidal waters.
* Height contours, going across areas having different values of vertical datum, must be split at the border of these areas.
* Meta features *Vertical Datum of Data* and *Sounding Datum*may overlap.

[underline]#Distinction:# Sounding Datum.

[[sec_3.11.1]]
==== Survey reliability and source of bathymetric data

The survey reliability and/or details of the source surveys used in compilation may be encoded using the Meta feature *Quality of Survey*.*Quality of Survey* can apply to bathymetry (for example, underwater rocks), non-bathymetry (for example, navigational aids) and a combination of these (for example, LIDAR survey).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* To express completeness of bathymetric data, the complex attribute *features detected* should be encoded. *features detected* indicates that a systematic method of exploring the seafloor was undertaken to detect significant features. The sub-attributes *size of features detected* and *least depth of detected features measured* must not be encoded unless the sub-attribute *significant features detected* is set to _True_.
* If it is required to encode a vertical uncertainty value, it must be encoded using the complex attribute *vertical uncertainty* on an instance of the information type *Spatial Quality* (see <<sec_24.5>>), associated to the relevant feature(s) point, multipoint and curve geometry, or an instance of the Meta feature *Quality of Bathymetric Data* (see <<sec_3.8>>).
* If the attribute *measurement distance maximum* is set to _0_ (zero) for the full area of the survey, the attribute *full seafloor coverage achieved* should be set to _yes_.
* Where populated, the value for the attribute *measurement distance minimum* must not be larger than the value populated for *measurement distance maximum*.
* *quality of horizontal measurement* on the *Quality of Survey*applies to bathymetric data situated within the area, while *quality of horizontal measurement* or *horizontal position uncertainty* on the associated spatial types qualifies the location of the *Quality of Survey*feature itself.
* The attributes *depth range maximum value* and *depth range minimum value* may be used to define the quality of individual surveys at varying depths in the water column, similar to the method used for indicating the overall quality of bathymetry using *Quality of Bathymetric Data* (see <<sec_3.8>>).

[[sec_3.11.2]]
==== Quality of sounding

If it is required to encode the quality of sounding, it must be done using the attribute *quality of vertical measurement* on either the *Quality of Survey*or on individual geo features (for example *Sounding*).

The quality of sounding must not be encoded using *quality of vertical measurement* on the depth geo feature, unless it is different from the value of *quality of vertical measurement* encoded on *Quality of Survey* (see <<table_11-1>> at <<sec_11.3.1>> and <<table_13-1>> at <<sec_13.3>>).

[[sec_3.11.3]]
==== Technique of vertical measurement

If it is required to encode the technique of sounding measurement, it must be done using the attribute *technique of vertical measurement* on either *Quality of Survey* or on individual geo features (for example *Sounding*).*technique of vertical measurement*must not be populated with multiple values to indicate the technique of sounding measurement for multiple surveys.*technique of vertical measurement* may be populated with multiple values only where the area is covered by a survey that has used multiple techniques, for example an area covered by a survey using a modern echosounder combined with a sonar or mechanical sweep system.

The technique of sounding measurement must not be encoded using *technique of vertical measurement* on the depth geo feature, unless it is different from the value of *technique of vertical measurement* encoded on an overlapping **Quality of Survey**; and the information is considered to be important to navigation.

* No remarks.

==== Update information

In S-100 ECDIS, the existing methodology in S-57/S-52 ECDIS used to provide, on request, a visual indication to the Mariner of information that has changed in the System Database when an ENC Update is applied will be implemented for this Edition of S-101. The following guidance, therefore, does not indicate any mandatory requirement for Data Producers or ECDIS Manufacturers in regard to IMO requirements for ECDIS performance.

The Meta feature *Update Information* may be used by the ECDIS to provide information to the Mariner of changes that have been applied in an ENC New Edition; or to provide additional information to the Mariner other than the visual indication when an ENC Update is applied. *Update Information* must be associated, where encoded, with features that have changed using the associations *Updated Information* (see <<sec_25.21>>) and *Update Aggregation* (see <<sec_25.20>>).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The mandatory attribute *update number* must be used, if required, to indicate the Update number of the Update dataset that the changed information is included in, as indicated in the file extension of the Update dataset.
* The mandatory attribute *update type* must be used, if required, to indicate the type of update applicable to the feature (insertion, deletion, modification, move). Where the *Update Information* is encoded to cover an area in which numerous changes have occurred (for example in a New Edition), *update type* should be populated with value _3_ (modify).
* The complex attribute *information* (see <<sec_2.4.6>>) should be used to provide a textual description of the changes to the associated feature(s) as included in the Update.
* The process of moving a segment of a curve or edge of a surface feature via an ENC Update requires the two-step application of the deletion of the segment at the original position and the insertion of the new segment in the new position. Where required, in order to indicate the move of a segment by ENC Update, three *Update Information* features should be created and associated, if required, as follows:

** An *Update Information* feature having *update type* = _2_ (delete) using the geometry of the deleted segment at the original position;
** An *Update Information* feature of type curve having *update type* = _1_ (insert) associated to the inserted segment at the new position;
** An *Update Information* feature having no geometry and *update type* = _4_ (move) associated to the above "delete" and "insert" *Update Information* features using the association *Update Aggregation* (see <<sec_25.20>>).
* The association *Update Aggregation* may also be used to group several related updates, for example changes to a routeing measure or aids to navigation range system. Where this is done, the *Update Information* forming the collection (container) end of the relationship should have no geometry and have *update type* = _3_ (modify).
* Where the changed information is related to an information type, the *Update Information* may be associated with the features to which the information type is associated.
* The attribute *source* may be used to indicate the related paper chart Notice to Mariner's number.
* At each New Edition of an ENC cell, *Update Information* features which are no longer relevant must be deleted; and for the next Update to an ENC cell *Update Information* features included in the previous Update dataset should be considered for deletion. Where a new Update impacts a feature that has previously been updated, any existing instance of *Update Information* associated to the feature must be deleted as part of the new Update; this must be done by deleting the existing *Update Information* from the dataset.
* The creation of *Update Information* Meta feature instances on request and the corresponding *Updated Information* and *Update Aggregation* association instances may be substantively automated in ENC production systems and associated databases, with automated population of the mandatory attributes *update number* and *update type* based on the change made to the data; and the complex attribute *fixed date range* and attribute *scale minimum* based on the attribution of the associated geo feature. The optional creation of these features and any additional information populated for *Update Information* is at the discretion of the Data Producer.
