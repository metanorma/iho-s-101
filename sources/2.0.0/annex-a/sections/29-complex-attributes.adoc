=== vertical clearance open

[cols="a",options="noheader,unnumbered"]

| [underline]#IHO Definition:# *VERTICAL CLEARANCE OPEN*. The vertical clearance of a feature in opened condition (for example an open lifting bridge) measured from the horizontal plane towards the feature overhead.(Adapted from S-57 Edition 3.1, Appendix A -- Chapter 2, Page 2.236, November 2000).

[underline]#Indication:# The complex attribute encodes the vertical distance from a defined vertical datum to the underside of an opening overhead feature when it is in the open position.
