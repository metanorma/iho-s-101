NOTE: To decide on a ZOC Category, all conditions outlined in columns 2 to 4 of the Table must be met.

[[footnote_27_74_1]]
[NOTE]
--
The allocation of a Zone of Confidence (ZOC) indicates that particular data meets minimum criteria for position and depth accuracy and seafloor coverage defined in this Table. ZOC categories reflect a charting standard and not just a hydrographic survey standard. Depth and position accuracies specified for each ZOC category refer to the errors of the final depicted soundings and include not only survey errors but also other errors introduced in the chart production process. Data is further qualified in Meta Feature Type *Quality of Bathymetric Data* (see <<sec_3.8>>) and associated Information Type *Spatial Quality* (see <<sec_24.5>>) attributes as follows:

. Positional Accuracy (*horizontal position uncertainty*) and Sounding Accuracy (*vertical uncertainty*) on the associated instance of *Spatial Quality* may be used to indicate that a higher position or depth accuracy has been achieved than defined in this Table (for example a survey where full seafloor coverage was not achieved could not be classified higher that ZOC B; however, if the position accuracy was, for instance, stem:[pm 15] metres, the attribute *horizontal position uncertainty* could be used to indicate this).

. Swept areas where the clearance depth is accurately known but the actual seabed depth is not accurately known may be accorded a 'higher' ZOC (that is, A1 or A2) providing positional and depth accuracies of the swept depth meets the criteria in this Table. In this instance, the attribute *depth range minimum value* on the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature may be used to specify the swept depth. The position accuracy criteria apply to the boundaries of swept areas.

. The complex attribute *survey date range* on the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature is used to indicate the start and end dates of the survey(s) covering the area.

[[footnote_27_74_4]]
[NOTE]

Significant seafloor features are defined as those rising above depicted depths by more than:

[cols="3",options="unnumbered"]
|===
|   h| Depth h| Significant Feature

| a. | stem:[< 40 "unitsml(m)"] | stem:[2 "unitsml(m)"]
| b. | stem:[> 40 "unitsml(m)"] | 10% depth
|===

A full seafloor search indicates that a systematic survey was conducted using detection systems, depth measurement systems, procedures, and trained personnel designed to detect and measure depths on significant seafloor features. Significant features are included on the chart as scale allows. It is impossible to guarantee that no significant feature could remain undetected, and significant features may have become present in the area since the time of the survey.

=== scale minimum (SCAMIN)

[cols="a",options="noheader,unnumbered"]
|===
| [underline]#IHO Definition:# *SCALE MINIMUM*. The minimum scale at which the feature may be used for example for ECDIS presentation.

[underline]#Attribute Type:# Integer

[underline]#Indication:# The modulus of the scale is indicated, that is 1:89&nbsp;999 is encoded as 89999.

[underline]#Unit:# None

[underline]#Minimum range:# 999

[underline]#Maximum range:# 19999999

[underline]#Range closure:# Closed interval (stem:["minimum" <=  bb"scale minimum" <= "maximum"])

[underline]#Example:# If a particular minimum scale is specified as 1:89&nbsp;999 (encoded as *89999*), and an example of a smaller scale would be 1:179&nbsp;999 (encoded as *179999*).

The *scale minimum* value of a feature determines the display scale below which the feature is no longer displayed. Its purpose is to reduce clutter, to prioritise the display of features and to improve display speed. In encoding its value, the producing authority should consider these factors, as well as the scale at which the feature is no longer likely to be required for navigation. In order to optimize the performance and clarity of the ENC, it is a mandatory requirement on ENCs that *scale minimum* is used.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* *scale minimum* only affects the display of a feature on an ECDIS, not its presence in the Electronic Navigational Data Service (ENDS).
* If *scale minimum* is not encoded, the feature is displayed at all scales.
* Where *scale minimum* is used, it must always be set to a scale less (that is, to a smaller scale) than the optimum display scale of the data as described in <<sec_2.5.5>>. Failure to follow this rule will mean that features will not be displayed on the ECDIS until the overscale indication is activated. See <<sec_2.5.9>>, <<table_2-6>>, for the list of mandatory *scale minimum* values.
* Skin of the Earth and Meta features must always be displayed. Therefore, *scale minimum* must not be encoded on Skin of the Earth and Meta features.
* If the same feature exists in datasets of different optimum display scales, the same *scale minimum* value must be assigned to each occurrence of the feature.

--

[underline]#Remarks:#

* This attribute is used to specify the datum to which both heights (vertical datum) and soundings (sounding datum) are referred.
* When the vertical datum is unknown, such as water areas above locks, the value "local datum" should be used, and further details may be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see <<sec_2.4.6>>).
* The Â± 0.3m approximation quoted in the "approximate" levels is arbitrary and follows the British example of their definition for "approximate LAT".
