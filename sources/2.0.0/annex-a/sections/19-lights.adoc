== Geo Features -- Lights

For the purpose of encoding lights in ENC, the following features
must be used, depending on the type of light:

* *Light All Around* (see <<sec_19.2>>) for lights having the same
character over the whole horizon of interest to marine navigation
(all-round lights), excluding fog detector and air obstruction
lights;
* *Light Sectored* (see <<sec_19.3>>) for lights having one or more
sectors which have different characteristics, including directional
lights and lights having obscured or partially obscured sectors;
* *Light Fog Detector* (see <<sec_19.4>>) for lights used to
automatically determine conditions of visibility which warrant the
turning on or off of a sound signal; and
* *Light Air Obstruction* (see <<sec_19.5>>) for lights marking an
obstacle which constitutes a danger to air navigation.

When encoding a light, the combination of the character and purpose
of the light must be evaluated in order to determine the most
appropriate light feature from the above list.

[[sec_19.1]]
=== Lights: General

[[sec_19.1.1]]
==== Rhythms of lights (see S-4 -- B-471.2)

The principal character of a light is its rhythm (although, strictly,
fixed lights and some alternating lights are not "rhythmic").

If it is required to encode the rhythms of lights, this must be done
using the complex attribute *rhythm of light*, sub-attributes *light
characteristic* and *signal group*. When populating *rhythm of
light*, the sub-attributes *signal group*, *signal period* and
*signal sequence* are only valid for non-fixed lights (that is,
sub-attribute stem:[bb "light characteristic" != 1] (fixed)), with
*signal group* and *signal period* being mandatory.

The use of these sub-attributes is defined in the following Table; it
contains the most common examples of coding; other coding
combinations are possible:

Some lights recently constructed may appear to the Mariner as "fixed
and flashing - FFL" by night, while the real-world feature actually
comprises two separate lights vertically disposed, one fixed and the
other flashing (F&Fl). When it is known that two separate features
actually exist, they must be encoded as separate light features, in
this case two *Light All Around* features, one with complex attribute
*rhythm of light*, sub-attribute stem:[bb "light characteristic" = 1]
(fixed) and the other with stem:[bb "light characteristic" = 2]
(flashing), and not as one *Light All Around* with stem:[bb "light
characteristic" = 13] (fixed/flash).

[[sec_19.1.2]]
==== Types and functions of lights (see S-4 -- B-471.1)

If it is required to encode types and functions of lights, this must
be done using the attribute *category of light* (see <<sec_27.37>>).

[[sec_19.1.3]]
==== Elevations of lights (see S-4 -- B-471.6)

The elevationof a light is the vertical distance between the light
source and the plane of reference for heights for the ENC data (see
<<sec_2.5.7>>).

If it is required to encode the elevation of a light on a fixed
structure, it must be done using the attribute *height*.

If it is required to encode the height above the water surface of a
light on a floating structure, it must be done using the attribute
*vertical length* on the relevant light feature (see <<sec_2.5.7>>).

[[sec_19.1.4]]
==== Times of exhibition and exhibition conditions (see S-4 -- B-473)

[[sec_19.1.4.1]]
===== Night lights

If it is required to encode a night light, it must be done using the
attribute stem:[bb "exhibition condition of light" = 4] (night light)
on the light feature.

[[sec_19.1.4.2]]
===== Unwatched lights (see S-4 -- B-473.1)

This information should not be encoded, but unwatched (unmanned)
lights, with no standby or emergency arrangements, may be encoded
using attribute stem:[bb "status" = 17] (unwatched).

[[sec_19.1.4.3]]
===== Occasional lights (see S-4 -- B-473.2)

If it is required to encode an occasional light, it must be done
using attribute stem:[bb "status" = 2] (occasional). If it is
required to encode a private light that is not regularly exhibited,
it must be done using stem:[bb "status" = 2,8] (occasional, private).

[[sec_19.1.4.4]]
===== Daytime lights (see S-4 -- B-473.4)

If it is required to encode a light shown throughout 24 hours without
change of character, it must be done using attribute stem:[bb
"exhibition condition of light" = 1] (light shown without change of
character).

If it is required to encode a light having characteristics shown by
day different from those shown at night, it must be done by encoding
two light features sharing the same point spatial instance:

* one light feature with
stem:[bb "exhibition condition of light" = 2] (daytime light),
* one light feature with
stem:[bb "exhibition condition of light" = 4] (night light).

[[sec_19.1.4.5]]
===== Fog lights (see S-4 -- B-473.5)

If it is required to encode a light which is exhibited in fog or
conditions of reduced visibility, it must be done using a light
feature, with attributes stem:[bb "exhibition condition of light" =
3] (fog light)and stem:[bb "status" = 2] (occasional)_._

If it is required to encode a light having characteristics shown in
fog that are different from those shown in conditions of normal
visibility, it must be done by encoding two light features sharing
the same point spatial instance:

* one light feature with stem:[bb "exhibition condition of light" =
3] (fog light) and stem:[bb "status" = 2] (occasional)
* one light feature with stem:[bb "exhibition condition of light" =
2] (daytime light) or _4_ (night light) and the complex attribute
*information* (see <<sec_2.4.6>>), sub-attribute *text* = _Character
of the light changes in fog_.

Note the distinction between fog lights and fog detector lights,
which are lights used to automatically determine conditions of
visibility which warrant the turning on or off of a sound signal. Fog
detector lights must be encoded, where required, using the feature
*Light Fog Detector* (see <<sec_19.4>>).

[[sec_19.1.4.6]]
===== Manually-activated lights (see S-4 -- B-473.5)

If a light is radio activated, the attribute *signal generation* must
be populated with value _5_ (radio activated). To encode the contact
information for activation of the light, it must be done using the
information type *Contact Details* (see <<sec_24.1>>). The *Contact
Details* must be associated to the light feature using the
association *Additional Information*.

If a light is activated by calling into a manned station, the
attribute *signal generation* must be populated with value _6_ (call
activated). To encode the contact information for the manned station,
it must be done using the information type *Contact Details*. The
*Contact Details* must be associated to the light feature using the
association *Additional Information*.

[[sec_19.1.5]]
==== Leading lights (see S-4 -- B-475.6)

If it is required to encode a leading light, it must be done using an
appropriate light feature, with attribute:

stem:[bb "category of light" =]::
_4,12_::: front leading light
_4,13_::: rear leading light
_4,14_::: lower leading light
_4,15_::: upper leading light

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Even if, on the source, the leading lights are merged into a single
symbol, a light feature must be created for each light. These lights
must be placed in their true position; that is, where the source
shows a single light with a legend such as _2F.Bu_, further
investigation must be done in order to determine the true position of
each light, and its full attribution. Compilers should note that
where this occurs on paper charts, the position of the light shown on
the chart normally corresponds with the rear leading light.
* The leading line must be encoded using the method described in
<<sec_15.1>>.

[[sec_19.1.6]]
==== Lighthouses (see S-4 -- B-457.3)

If it is required to encode a lighthouse, it must be done using a
*Landmark* feature (see <<sec_7.2>>), with attributes stem:[bb
"category of landmark" = 17] (tower) and stem:[bb "function" = 33]
(light support)for towers, or using a *Building* feature (see
<<sec_6.2>>), with the attribute stem:[bb "function" = 33], for any
other shapes.

If it is required to encode the attributes *elevation*, *height* and
*vertical length* for a lighthouse, this must be done as described in
<<sec_19.1.3>>.

If the lighthouse is permanently extinguished/unlit, this must be
indicated by population of the attribute stem:[bb "status" = 4] (not
in use) for the *Landmark*/*Building*, and the lightfeature must be
removed. Where a lighthouse is illuminated by flood lights, the
additional value of stem:[bb "status" = 12] (illuminated) must also
be populated. For lights that are temporarily extinguished, see
<<sec_31.2.2>> -- paragraph 10(i).

[[sec_19.1.7]]
==== Various special types of lights

| Flood light | B-478.2 | _8_ | Only to encode flood lights that are

*information*, sub-attribute *text* indicating the colour; for example,
_Purple when flood lit_.

| Synchronized lights | B-478.3 | | stem:[bb "status" = 15]. A series

_lights disposed in the shape of a triangle_. The number of lights

|===

[[sec_19.1.8]]
==== Light structures

Light features located in the water must have a structure feature,
generally a beacon (for example *Lateral Beacon*, *Special
Purpose/General Beacon*) or other fixed structure (for example
*Offshore Platform*), or a buoy structure (for example *Lateral
Buoy*, *Special Purpose/General Buoy*) for floating aids to
navigation. When a light is located in the water with no indication
on the source of the structure feature, regardless of the height of
the light, a *Pile* feature of type surface or a *Special
Purpose/General Beacon* feature should be encoded as the structure
feature. This will ensure that a symbol will be shown on ECDIS
systems when the light features are not displayed during daytime
navigation.

The light portrayal rules for ECDIS result in the display of *Light
All Around* features with Boolean attribute *major light* = _True_
using a stem:[360 "unitsml(deg)"] light sector. On land, if no aid to
navigation structure object has been encoded at the position of these
lights, the Mariner does not have a displayed centre point to take
bearings to:

[[fig_19-1]]
.Omnidirectional light display in ECDIS
image::figure-19-1.jpeg["",602,315]

Encoders are advised, therefore, that an aid to navigation structure
object (for example *Special Purpose/General Beacon*, *Pile*) should
be encoded as a light structure object for all *Light All Around*
features on land encoded as major lights, where the nature of the
structure object is unknown.

[[sec_19.2.1]]
==== All around lights (see S-4 -- B-470)

If it is required to encode an all around light (excluding fog
detector and air obstruction lights), it must be done using the
feature *Light All Around*. This feature must be an equipment feature
of a structure feature (see <<sec_18.2>>), which may be another light
feature at the same position (if it exists and there is no structure
feature available), using a *Structure/Equipment* feature association.

The IALA Maritime Buoyage Systemrules do not apply for most landfall
lights and will apply to minor lights, but not to leading lights,
some sector lights or major floating lights. In general, sector
lights follow IALA convention when used for marking a channel.

Further guidance for encoding various types and characteristics of
lights can be found in <<sec_19.1.1;to!sec_19.1.7>>.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* All sector lights, whether single sectored, multi-sectored or
having sectors that are deliberately obscured or completely or
partially obscured by obstructions, must be encoded, where required,
using the feature *Light Sectored* (see <<sec_19.3>>); for encoding a
directional sector or bearing, see <<sec_19.3.1.2>>.
* Fog detector and air obstruction lights must be encoded, where
required, using the features *Light Fog Detector* and *Light Air
Obstruction* (see <<sec_19.4;and!sec_19.5>>).
* If it is required to encode details of the lighting technology (for
example neon), it must be done using the complex attribute
*information* (see <<sec_2.4.6>>).

* If it is required to encode the purpose of a marine spotlight, it
must be done using the complex attribute *information*.
* Lights on land encoded as major lights (Boolean attribute *major
light* = _True_) must have a structure feature encoded (see
<<sec_19.1.8>>) in order for the position of the light to be clearly
indicated in the ECDIS.
* The attribute *vertical datum* applies only to *height*; this value
must only be encoded if it is different from the value of *vertical
datum* encoded on the underlying Meta feature *Vertical Datum of
Data* (see <<sec_3.10>>).
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only
applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to
indicate the reference datum for the height of the light in tidal
waters.
* The attribute *vertical length* only applies to lights attached to
floating structures (see <<sec_2.5.7>>).
* The indication that a light is a "major" light through the
population of the Boolean attribute *major light* with a _True_ value
determines the way the light is displayed in ECDIS, and is not based
on any legal or formal classification of the importance of lights.
Generally, a major light may be considered to be a light intended for
use at sea, usually with a range of 15 miles or more, and in outer
approaches to harbours. However the determination of what is a major
light may be based on a number of additional factors, including the
number and characteristics of navigational (and non-navigational)
lights in the geographical area, and specific navigational
requirements for the area. Indication in a dataset that a light is a
major light should be based only on the requirements for ECDIS
display, at the discretion of the Producing Authority.
* Names of major lightsare very important. If a light has a name
which is unrelated to any other encoded feature, the name must be
populated using the complex attribute *feature name* (see
<<sec_2.5.8>>) on at least the largest optimum display scale ENC
data. If the name of a light is obviously that of the named feature
on which the light stands, for example Saint Catherine's Point, the
name of the light need not be repeated for the light.

[[sec_19.3.1]]
==== Sectored lights (see S-4 -- B-475)

If it is required to encode a light that consists of one or more
sectors, it must be done using the feature *Light Sectored*. This
feature must be an equipment feature of a structure feature (see
<<sec_18.1>>), which may be another light feature at the same
position (if it exists and there is no structure feature available),
using a *Structure/equipment* feature association.

The IALA Maritime Buoyage Systemrules do not apply for most landfall
lights and will apply to minor lights, but not to leading lights,
some sector lights or major floating lights. In general, sector
lights follow IALA convention when used for marking a channel.

Further guidance for encoding various types and characteristics of
lights can be found in <<sec_9.1.1>>.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The complex attribute *sector characteristics*, sub-complex
attribute *light sector* is used to populate each sector for the
light, except for sectors in which there is no light exhibited. Where
there is a different rhythm of light between sectors (for example,
for complex lights), separate instances of *sector characteristics*
must be populated.
* Population of the sub-complex attribute *sector limit* having
sub-attributes stem:[bb "sector limit one" = 0] and stem:[bb "sector
limit two" = 360] (that is, encoding an all around light as a
sectored light) is prohibited.
* If a sector of a sectored light is intended to have a directional
function, this must be encoded using the *light sector* complex
sub-attribute *directional character*. If the light is intensified in
this sector, *light sector* sub-attribute stem:[bb "light visibility"
= 4] (intensified) must be populated. The sub-complex attribute
*sector limit* is optional for directional light sectors.
* The sub-attribute *sector line length* (see <<sec_27.158>>) may be
used for critical light sectors to extend the sector line when the
ECDIS display settings are set to display default sector lines. The
intended usage of the ENC dataset must be considered when determining
the usage of *sector line length* so as to avoid excessive screen
clutter when default sector display is enabled; and consistent
display of light sectors across the entire ENC portfolio should also
be a consideration when determining the population of this attribute.
Where populated, the value of *sector line length* must not exceed
the value populated for the sub-attribute *value of nominal range*
for the light sector.
* In some cases the area defined by the intersecting sectors of two
discrete sector lights are used to indicate the existence of isolated
and sometimes substantial dangers to navigation, the precise position
of which may not be known. When default sectors are displayed in
ECDIS, the extent and intent of these sectors may not be clearly
defined to the Mariner. In order to more clearly indicate these
areas, compilers should consider appropriate use of *sector line
length* for the relevant sectors in the impacted area. Where it is
considered important that the area of possible danger is defined,
this should be done by encoding a *Caution Area* feature (see
<<sec_16.10>>) covering the intersection area. Information relating
to the definition of the area by sector lights and a précis of the
danger should be encoded using the complex attribute *information*
(see <<sec_2.4.6>>) for the *Caution Area*.
* The fairway defined by the succession of navigable areas in the
white sectors of a series of *Light Sectored* features may be encoded
using the feature *Fairway* (see <<sec_15.7>>).
* If there is additional information required to be encoded that is
relevant to all sectors of the light, this must be done using the
*information* (see <<sec_2.4.6>>). If the additional information is
relevant to individual sectors of the light only (for example, for
complex (oscillating) light sectors (see <<sec_19.3.1.3>> below)),
this must be encoded using the complex sub-attribute *sector
information* for the sub-complex attribute *light sector*.
* If it is required to encode details of the lighting technology (for
example neon), it must be done using the complex attribute
*information*.

* The attribute *vertical datum* applies only to *height*; this value
must only be encoded if it is different from the value of *vertical
datum* encoded on the underlying Meta feature *Vertical Datum of
Data* (see <<sec_3.10>>).
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only
applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to
indicate the reference datum for the height of the light in tidal
waters.
* Names of major lightsare very important. If a light has a name
which is unrelated to any other encoded feature, the name must be
populated using the complex attribute *feature name* (see
<<sec_2.5.8>>) on at least the largest scale optimum display scale
ENC data. If the name of a light is obviously that of the named
feature on which the light stands, for example Saint Catherine's
Point, the name of the light need not be repeated for the light.

[[sec_19.3.1.1]]
===== Lights obscured by obstructions (see S-4 -- B-475.3)

[[fig_19-2]]
.Obscured light sectors
image::figure-19-2.png[498,198]

If an encoded light is obscured in a part of the navigable area of a
sector (see <<fig_19-2>> (A) above) beyond an offshore obstruction,
it must be encoded using *Light Sectored*, with each of the sectors
(a) -- (c) encoded using the complex attribute *light sector*. The
partially obscured sector of (b) must have *light sector* with
sub-attributes stem:[bb "light visibility" = 8] (partially obscured)
and sub-attribute *value of nominal range* set to the distance from
the light to the obstruction. The sectors in which the light is
visible from seaward ((a) and (c)) must be encoded as separate
iterations of *light sector*.

If there is no navigable water between the light and the obstacle
(see (e) in <<fig_19-2>> (B) above), the masked sector must not have
an iteration of *light sector* encoded, unless a faint light is
visible in the navigable part of the sector, which should be encoded
using *light sector*, with sub-attribute stem:[bb "light visibility"
= 3] (faint). The sectors in which the light is visible from seaward
((d) and (f)) must be encoded as separate iterations of *sector
characteristics*.

[[sec_19.3.1.2]]
===== Directional lights (see S-4 -- B-475.7-8)

Directional (or direction) lightsof several types are in use but all
have in common a very narrow sector intended to mark a direction to
be followed. The narrow sector may be flanked by:

* Unlit sectors or unintensified light.
* Sectors of different colour or character.

Some direction lights are so precise that a complete colour change at
a sector boundary occurs over an angle of less than 1 minute (0∙02°).
This corresponds to a lateral distance of just 1 metre at a viewing
distance of 3.5 km. In addition the intensity may be maintained right
to the edge of the beam, and does not reduce the further the observer
is away from the axis.
A moiré effect mark (or variable arrow mark)is a short-range
(normally up to 2 km) type of directional "light". Sodium lighting
gives a yellow background to a screen (up to 3 m square) on which a
vertical black line will be seen by an observer on the centreline, or
variable arrow marks when course alteration is needed. The system can
be used by day and night. It can also be used as a stop line (seen
abeam) for vessels berthing along quays.

If it is required to encode a light sector having a directional
function, it must be done using the feature *Light Sectored*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The indication that a particular light sector has a directional
function is encoded by populating the complex attribute *sector
characteristics*, sub-complex attribute *directional character*.
* The mandatory complex sub-attribute *orientation* must only be
encoded to indicate the orientation, measured from seaward, of the
leading line of the directional light sector when there is no
*Recommended Track* or *Navigation Line* feature associated with the
directional light. Where the directional sector has an associated
*Recommended Track* and/or *Navigation Line*, *orientation*
(*orientation value*) for the light sector must be populated with an
empty (null) value.
* For a sector indicated as directional, the *light sector* complex
sub-complex attribute *sector limit* is optional.
* For moiré effect lights, the Boolean sub-attribute *moiré effect*
must be set to _True_.

* If it is required to encode the recommended track and/or navigation
line associated with a directional light, it must be done using the
methods described in <<sec_15.1>>.

[[sec_19.3.1.3]]
===== Oscillating light sectors

Evolving technology in the development of navigational lights has
resulted in the installation of complex directional navigation lights
with multiple sectors, colours and characteristics, some with
oscillating sectors, in many areas where navigation is restricted.
These lights may have up to 7 sectors, with the central sector being
a very narrow, sometimes intensified, fixed white sector performing
the directional function of the light. In the IALA A System, the
sectors flanking this directional light may be alternating and
oscillate increasingly from white to green (to starboard) and red (to
port) with increasing deviation from the track defined by the
directional light. These lights will normally be flanked by narrow
sectors of fixed green (to starboard) and red (to port).
Additionally, there may be outer sectors that are occulting green (to
starboard) and red (to port) which oscillate with increasing period
of eclipse to isophased or flashing with increasing deviation from
the track defined by the directional light. For the IALA B System the
colours are reversed. In some cases these complex lights may not
conform to IALA. Each of the outer sectors may be very narrow.

If is required to encode an oscillating light sector, it should be
done using a *Light Sectored* feature, with iterations of the complex
attribute *sector characteristics* as follows: For light sectors in
the IALA A system that are alternating and oscillate increasingly
from white to green (to starboard) and red (to port) with increasing
deviation from the track defined by the directional light:

*sector characteristics*: stem:[bb "light characteristic" = 28]
(Alternating); stem:[bb "colour" = 1,3] (White, Red); *sector limit*;
*sector information* (*text*) = _White phase decreases as bearing to
light increases_

*sector characteristics*: stem:[bb "light characteristic" = 28]
(Alternating); stem:[bb "colour" = 1,4] (White, Green); *sector
limit*; *sector information* (*text*) = _White phase increases as
bearing to light increases_

For lights in the IALA B system that are alternating and oscillate
increasingly from white to red (to starboard) and green (to port)
with increasing deviation from the track defined by the directional
light; transpose the colours red and green in the above encoding.

For lights in the IALA A system that are occulting green (to
starboard) and red (to port) which oscillate with increasing period
of eclipse to isophased or flashing with increasing deviation from
the track defined by the directional light:

*sector characteristics*: stem:[bb "light characteristic" = 8]
(Occulting); stem:[bb "colour" = 3] (Red); *sector limit*; *sector
information* (*text*) = _Light phase decreases as bearing to light
increases_

**sector characteristics*: stem:[bb "light characteristic" = 8]
(Occulting); stem:[bb "colour" = 4] (Green); *sector limit*; *sector
information* (*text*) = _Light phase increases as bearing to light
increases_

For lights in the IALA B system that are occulting red (to starboard)
and green (to port) which oscillate with increasing period of eclipse
to isophased or flashing with increasing deviation from the track
defined by the directional light; transpose the colours red and green
in the above encoding.

Oscillating lights which are not IALA should be encoded similar to
the above. For instance, where a light contains white sectors that
are occulting and oscillate with increasing period of eclipse to
isophased or flashing with increasing deviation from the track
defined by the directional light:For the sector to port of the track
defined by the directional light:

*sector characteristics*: stem:[bb "light characteristic" = 8]
(Occulting); stem:[bb "colour" = 1] (White); *sector limit*; *sector
information* (*text*) = _Light phase decreases as bearing to light
increases_

For the sector to starboard of the track defined by the directional
light:

*sector characteristics*: stem:[bb "light characteristic" = 8]
(Occulting); stem:[bb "colour" = 1] (White); *sector limit*; *sector
information* (*text*) = _Light phase increases as bearing to light
increases_

All other light sectors must be encoded using additional iterations
of *sector characteristics*, with sub-attributes (including *light
sector* or *directional character*) populated in accordance with the
characteristics of the sector.

==== Fog detector lights (see S-4 -- B-477)

If it is required to encode a light used to automatically determine
conditions of visibility which warrant the turning on or off of a
sound signal, it must be done using the feature *Light Fog Detector*.
This feature must be an equipment feature of a structure feature (see
<<sec_18.1>>), if it exists, using a *Structure/Equipment* feature
association.

Further guidance for encoding various types and characteristics of
lights can be found in <<sec_19.1.1;to!sec_19.1.7>>.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode details of the lighting technology (for
instance neon), it must be done using the complex attribute
*information* (see <<sec_2.4.6>>).

* The attribute *vertical datum* applies only to *height*; this value
must only be encoded if it is different from the value of *vertical
datum* encoded on the underlying Meta feature *Vertical Datum of
Data* (see <<sec_3.10>>).
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only
applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to
indicate the reference datum for the height of the light in tidal
waters.
* The attribute *vertical length* only applies to lights attached to
floating structures (see <<sec_2.5.7>>).
