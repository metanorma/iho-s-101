== Geo Features -- Areas, limits

[[sec_16.1]]
=== International boundaries and national limits (see S-4 -- B-440)

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), 1982
came into force on 16 November 1994. UNCLOS contains navigational
provisions as well as provisions for determining the limits of
various maritime zones. These provisions are binding to all states
that have ratified the Convention. For technical aspects of UNCLOS,
see IHO publication C-51.

IHO Member States should show, on selected series of their ENCs,
their own baseline and maritime limits in accordance with UNCLOS.

The Mariner may be interested in the exact location of international
maritime boundaries for two principal reasons:

* When crossing a boundary they could be subject to different laws
and regulations which may affect their navigation; for example
buoyage systems, pilotage regulations, fishing rights, reporting
procedures, pollution regulations.

* Where a boundary passes through groups of offshore islands they may
wish to know upon which side of the boundary a particular island
falls.

=== Maritime jurisdiction areas

[[fig_16-2]]
.Maritime jurisdiction areas in constrained waters
image::figure-16-2.png["",569,329]

The clauses in <<sec_16>> below provide guidance for the encoding of
maritime jurisdiction areas. Occasionally, these "areas" may actually
be defined as linear due to international treaties; or the areas may
not be fully defined and it may therefore be necessary to encode the
boundary as a linear feature (see example at <<fig_16-3>> below).
<<sec_2.3>> defining features permitted for use in ENC and their
geometric primitives allows relevant feature classes relating to
maritime jurisdiction areas to be encoded as type curve; however this
must only be done in circumstances where it is not possible to encode
the feature using geometric primitive surface.

[[fig_16-3]]
.Maritime jurisdiction -- areas cannot be defined
image::figure-16-3.png[]

In <<fig_16-3>>, Administration Areas A and B cannot be encoded using
geometric primitive surface as the seaward edge of the areas is not
defined. In this case, the section of the international boundary
extending seaward from the low water line should be encoded as an
*Administration Area* feature of type curve (see <<sec_16.8>>).

[[sec_16.2.1]]
==== Maritime jurisdiction areas in dispute

In accordance with Article 55 of the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea (UNCLOS -- 10 December 1982), a Coastal State's
Territorial Sea Area and Exclusive Economic Zone must not overlap.
Occasionally, small areas at the boundary of two or more Coastal
States may be in dispute regarding the establishment of maritime
jurisdiction, which may result in a small section of Territorial Sea
overlapping an EEZ in the disputed area.

Where issues of maritime jurisdiction between two or more Coastal
States are in dispute, the proposed Territorial Sea (*Territorial Sea
Area*) of one Coastal State may overlap the proposed EEZ (*Exclusive
Economic Zone*) of another Coastal State. In this case, the disputed
area should be encoded with separate *Territorial Sea Area* and
*Exclusive Economic Zone* features, with Boolean attribute *in
dispute* set to _True_ and the mandatory attribute *nationality*
populated with the country codes (conforming to ISO 3166) of the
disputing states (see <<sec_27.135>>).

==== Anchorages (see S-4 -- B-431.1; B-431.3 and B-431.7)

Where the limits of anchorages are defined by a regulatory authority
(for example harbour authority) they must be shown on the largest
optimum display scale ENC data. They may also be shown on other
optimum display scale ENC datasets where useful, for example, for
planning purposes.

If it is required to encode an anchorage area, including anchorages
for seaplanes, it must be done using the feature *Anchorage Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The complex attribute *feature name*, sub-attribute *name* is used
to encode the name and/or number of the *Anchorage Area*.
* The complex attribute *information* (see <<sec_2.4.6>>) may be used
to provide additional information about the category of anchorage,
where required.
* Individual recommended anchorages without defined limits should be
encoded as *Anchorage Area* features of type point, with attributes
stem:[bb "category of anchorage" = 1] (unrestricted anchorage) and
stem:[bb "status" = 3] (recommended).
* If it is required to encode an anchorage at a location that has not
been defined by a regulatory authority but has been reported to be
suitable and safe for anchoring, this must be done using *Anchorage
Area* of type point, with attribute stem:[bb "category of anchorage"
= 15] (reported anchorage).

NOTE: the encoding of *Anchorage Area* with attribute stem:[bb
"category of anchorage" = 15] (reported anchorage) of type surface is
prohibited.

* If it is required to encode an anchorage which may be used for a
period of not more than 24 hours, it must be done using stem:[bb
"category of anchorage" = 9] (anchorage for periods up to 24 hours).
* If it is required to encode an anchorage with a specific, limited
time period, it must be done using stem:[bb "category of anchorage" =
10] (anchorage for limited period of time). The specific limit of
time should be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see
<<sec_2.4.6>>), sub-attribute *text* (for example_Anchorage limited
to 12 hours_).
* Areas with numerous small craft moorings may be encoded using the
feature *Mooring Area* (see <<sec_16.4>>). For the encoding of
mooring buoys, see <<sec_20.8>>.
* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed
limits, see <<sec_17.4>>.
* Areas where anchoring is prohibited must be encoded, where
required, as *Restricted Area* (see <<sec_17.8>>) with attribute
stem:[bb "restriction" = 1] (anchoring prohibited).

==== Dumping grounds (see S-4 -- B-442; B-446 and B-446.1)

Materials deliberately dumped at sea in specified areas (other than
those associated with reclamation works) may be classified, according
to their significance to the Mariner, as follows:

** Materials which are generally dispersed before reaching the
seabed, for example sewage sludge, are of little navigational
significance and no charting action is usually required.
** Spoil from dredging operations or other works which might reduce
charted depths significantly in the designated spoil ground.
** Harmful materials, including explosives and chemicals, which are
likely to remain concentrated on the seabed.
Dumping of harmful materials is unlikely to affect depths
substantially and such dumping grounds are encoded primarily as a
warning against anchoring, trawling or other submarine operations.

If it is required to encode a dumping ground, it must be done using
the feature *Dumping Ground*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* A *Dumping Ground* feature of type surface must be covered by
features from Skin of the Earth as appropriate (*Depth Area* or
*Unsurveyed Area*).
* Disused dumping grounds for harmful materialsare considered
dangerous for an indefinite period and must therefore be encoded on
the largest optimum display scale ENC datasets, with attribute
stem:[bb "status" = 4] (not in use). The date when the area ceased to
be used may be populated using the attribute *date disused*, if known.
* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed
limits, see <<sec_17.4>>.

[[sec_16.7.2]]
==== Spoil grounds, dredging areas (see S-4 -- B-446)

Spoil grounds are areas set aside, clear of shipping channels and in
deep water where possible, for the disposal of material (spoil)
generally obtained by dredging. Their significance to the Mariner is
that very large quantities of material may be dumped, decreasing the
depth of water available. Where possible, charts should be updated in
a timely manner so as to include the latest survey information
covering the spoil ground.

Extraction (or dredging) areas are those areas where a concentration
of dredging vessels may be encountered, taking up sand or shingle to
be brought ashore (for example for construction purposes). Their
significance is primarily as a collision hazard, although they also
indicate the likelihood of finding a greater depth of water than
charted. Channels dredged to provide an adequate depth of water for
navigation are "dredged areas", not to be confused with "dredging
areas".

If it is required to encode a spoil ground, it must be done using a
*Dumping Ground* feature, with attribute stem:[bb "category of
dumping ground" = 5] (spoil ground).

If it is required to encode a dredging area, it must be done using a
*Restricted Area* feature (see <<sec_17.8>>), with attribute stem:[bb
"category of restricted area" = 21] (dredging area). An area in which
seabed material (for example sand, shingle) is being extracted for
purposes such as construction must be encoded, where required, using
the feature *Offshore Production Area* (see <<sec_14.6>>), with
attribute stem:[bb "category of production area" = 13] (seabed
material extraction area).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Within a spoil ground; if the depths within the area are liable to
be very much less than charted after the discharge of spoil and
post-dumping surveys are not available, they may be treated as
unsurveyed areas (see <<sec_11.10>>), in which case soundings and
depth contours may be omitted from the area. Alternatively, an
indication of the discrepancy between charted depth information and
the actual depths within the spoil ground may be provided by
downgrading the information included in the underlying *Quality of
Bathymetric Data* feature (see <<sec_3.8>>).

==== Military practice areas (see S-4 -- B-441.1-6)

Military practice (or exercise) areas at sea are of various types and
may be classified as follows with regard to their significance for
the Mariner:

* Firing danger areas, sometimes called firing practice areas; that
is, permanent or temporary ranges, including bombing, torpedo and
missile ranges.
* Mine-laying practice (and counter-measures) areas.
* Submarine exercise areas.
* Other exercise areas.
Some degree of restrictionon navigation and other rights may be
implied by the encoding of military practice areas. There may be
varying interpretations of the validity of the restrictions and
possible infringement of the rights of innocent passage through
territorial waters and elsewhere. Where it is thought desirable to
depict such areas, even though clear range procedure may be observed,
or the areas appear to be a derogation of the freedom of the seas,
Mariners should be informed (not necessarily on ENCs) that
publication of the details of a law or regulation is solely for the
safety and convenience of shipping and implies no recognition of the
international validity of the law or regulation. By this means
infringements are not condoned but the Mariner receives a warning
which may be necessary for their safety.

If it is required to encode a military practice area, it must be done
using the feature *Military Practice Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed
limits, see <<sec_17.4>>.
* Submarine exercise areas should generally not be encoded where
submarines exercise over wide areas which it would not be practicable
to depict, and over which cautions (to keep a good look out for them)
are unlikely to be effective. They may, however, be encoded where
they occur in or near major shipping lanes or port approaches.
* Firing danger areas at seaare frequently marked by IALA special
buoys sometimes laid around the perimeter of the area and/or by
specially erected lights, beacons and targets. If required, all such
features which could assist the navigator in identifying their
position, or could be a hazard, must be encoded in the normal way,
* The existence of mine laying (and counter-measures/clearance)
practice areas implies the possibility of unexploded mines or depth
charges on the seafloor, and also the presence of harmless practice
mines.

==== International and national territories (see S-4 -- B-440.1 and B-440.3)

International maritime boundariesare those which have been
established by agreement between adjacent or opposite States.
Boundaries are sometimes negotiated on the basis of the equidistance
or "median" line principle. For various reasons, however, agreed
boundaries even when negotiated on this principle are seldom true
median lines. Navigationally, international boundaries may vary in
their significance over different parts of their lengths. Inshore,
they may represent the delimitation of Territorial Seas of two states
or "internal waters", (for example within bay closing lines or
straight baseline systems). Offshore, they may represent Exclusive
Economic Zone and/or Continental Shelf boundaries.

If it is required to encode a named international or national
territory, it must be done using the feature *Administration Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* International land boundaries should be encoded, at least in the
vicinity of coasts.
* *Administration Area* must only be encoded using the geometric
primitive curve where the real-world instance is actually linear, and
it is therefore not possible to encode the feature using the
geometric primitive surface. See <<sec_16.2>>.

==== Cargo transhipment areas (see S-4 -- B-449.4)

Areas generally outside port limits may be specifically designated as
suitable for the transhipment of oil or other materials from large
ships to smaller vessels. The areas selected are relatively sheltered
locations and lie off main shipping routes. As the purpose of
transhipment is usually to reduce the draught of the larger vessel to
allow it to proceed to port, the operation is often known as
"lightening" and the areas may be known as "lightening areas" or
"cargo transfer areas".

If it is required to encode a cargo transhipment area, it must be
done using the feature *Cargo Transhipment Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed
limits, see <<sec_17.4>>.
* The encoding of cargo transhipment areas should be adequate to warn
other vessels of the likelihood of encountering ships restricted in
their ability to manoeuvre. Regulations governing the use of such
areas should be encoded using the attribute *restriction* or the
complex attribute *information* (see <<sec_2.4.6>>).

==== Caution areas (see S-4 -- B-242)

If it is required to identify an area in which the Mariner must be
aware of circumstances influencing the safety of navigation (for
example an area of continually changing depths), and which cannot be
encoded using other feature types, it must be done using the feature
*Caution Area*. This feature may be required to identify a danger, a
risk, a rule or advice that is not directly related to a particular
feature.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If the information applies to a specific area the *Caution Area*
feature should cover only that area.
* If the information to be encoded is spatially linear, this should
be encoded using a "very narrow" *Caution Area* feature of type
surface (approximately 0·3mm wide at the optimum display scale of the
ENC data).
* Information which may be of use to the Mariner, but is not
significant to safe navigation and cannot be encoded using other
feature types, should be encoded using an *Information Area* feature
(see <<sec_16.12>>). This encoding is intended to reduce the number
of alarms or indications generated in the ECDIS due to the overuse of
*Caution Area* features.
* Notes should be kept to a minimum and be as concise as is
compatible with accuracy and intelligibility. Hydrographic
terminology (jargon) should be avoided, giving preference to easily
understood words, for example "depths" rather than "bathymetry".
* In order to ensure correct ECDIS display, *Caution Area* features
of type surface should not share the geometry of features such as
*Depth Contour* and other features with higher ECDIS display
priorities (that is, higher than display priority 3), as the *Caution
Area* will appear to be "open ended", which may confuse the Mariner.
Where this occurs, the edge of the *Caution Area* should be extended
outward to clear the "shared" edge, sufficient to avoid "duplicate
geometry" validation errors (that is, at least 0.3mm at the optimum
display scale for the ENC data).

==== Fishery zones (see S-4 -- B-440.7)

A fishery zoneis an area inside and beyond the Territorial Sea where
a coastal State proclaims that it alone may regulate fishing. Where
States have permitted others to fish in parts of the area, it may be
desirable to encode the area of both the full area and the area of
special concessionary rights. In some instances, claims are described
as "conservation zones"; for practical purposes these may be classed
with fishery zones since their intended function is to institute
fishery conservation measures. Most of the fishery zone claims are
limited by fixed distance (200 nautical miles in some cases) from the
Territorial Sea baselines.

If it is required to encode a fishery zone, it must be done using the
feature *Fishery Zone*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Fishery zones commonly coincide with other national jurisdiction
areas such as Continental Shelf and Exclusive Economic Zone. Where
this occurs, Producing Authorities may choose to omit the *Fishery
Zone* from the area covered by these other national jurisdiction
areas, as the fact that fishing regulations apply in these areas is
implicit.
* An indication of the fishery zone limit (for example 6 mile, 12
mile) may be encoded using the complex attribute *feature name*.

[underline]#Distinction:# Administration Area; Contiguous Zone;
Continental Shelf Area; Exclusive Economic Zone; Fishing Ground;
Restricted Area; Territorial Sea Area.

==== Straight Territorial Sea Baselines (see S-4 -- B-440.4)

A Territorial Sea is delimited by:

* Territorial Sea Baselines (drying lines);
* Straight Territorial Sea Baselines;
* International maritime boundaries (see <<sec_16.1>>); and
* Seaward limits of Territorial Seas (see <<sec_16.2>>).
The term "Baseline" refers to the line from which the breadth of the
Territorial Sea, the outer limits of the Contiguous Zone, the
Exclusive Economic Zone and, in some cases, the Continental Shelf are
measured. It is also the dividing line between internal watersand
territorial seas. Internal waters comprise all areas of the sea on
the landward side of the Territorial Sea Baselines, as well as inland
waters including rivers, lakes, etc.

The normal baselineis the low water line (which is not defined any
more precisely by UNCLOS) of the mainland, islands, or low tide
elevations, as depicted on large scale charts officially recognised
by the coastal State; they therefore do not require depiction in
ENCs. Features which are naturally-formed and dry at low water (for
example rocks, reefs, sand banks) may be considered low-tide
elevations and included in the baseline (details are given in UNCLOS
- see IHO publication C-51).

A straight baselinemay be used:

* as a closing line across the mouth or estuary of a river;
* as a closing line across the mouth of a juridical bay or a
historical bay;
* as part of a system of Straight Territorial Sea Baselines, for
example to connect seaward points on a deeply indented coastline, a
coastline that is fringed with islands, around unstable coastlines; or
* as an archipelagic baseline.
If it is required to encode a Straight Territorial Sea Baseline, it
must be done using the feature *Straight Territorial Sea Baseline*.

==== Submarine transit lanes (see S-4 -- B-441.5)

Submarine transit lanes should not generally be encoded because
submarines exercise over wide areas which it would not be practicable
to depict, and over which cautions (to keep a good look out for them)
are unlikely to be effective. They may, however, be encoded where
they occur in or near major shipping lanes or port approaches.

If it is required to encode a submarine transit lane, it must be done
using the feature *Submarine Transit Lane*.
