[[sec_12.1.1]]
==== Description of the seabed (see S-4 -- B-425 to B-427)

The nature (quality) of the seabed (bottom) must be shown in sufficient detail, where known and on the appropriate optimum display scale ENC data, for such purposes as:

* to give some guidance on holding characteristics when anchoring;
* to help in assessing the stability of shoals and to distinguish rocks from unconsolidated material, when navigating in shoal areas;
* to show where vessels may safely take the ground at low water in tidal areas; or
* to give an indication of the nature of the seabed in deeper waters for fishermen and submariners.
If it is required to encode an area of the sea where the nature of the seabed is homogeneous, it must be done using the feature *Seabed Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Generally, it is not possible to define a seabed area by its real extent, due to seabed samples usually being obtained at discrete locations. For that reason, the characteristics of the seabed area may be represented at one single position.
* Where the seabed comprises a mixture of material, *surface characteristics* must be populated as multiple iterations, with the main constituent given first.
* Where the seabed comprises layered material that is of relevance to navigation or anchoring, *surface characteristics* must be populated as multiple iterations, with the surface constituent given first, with a value for the attribute *underlying layer* of _0_. Successive layers below the surface must have *underlying layer* set to __1__, __2__, â€¦ .

[[fig_12-1]]
.Seabed areas
image::figure-12-1.png[Shape28,612,436]

* In the following clauses, the paragraph prefixes refer to the examples shown in <<fig_12-1>>.
(a) Mixed natures: The dominant nature of the seabed (*nature of surface*) should be populated first, along with its associated qualifying term (*nature of surface -- qualifying terms*), if required, using the complex attribute *surface characteristics*. Other natures should then be populated, in order of dominance, using further ordered instances of *surface characteristics*, (b) Underlying material: Should be encoded in the same way as mixed natures, and populating the sub-attribute *underlying layer* with the appropriate level of the layer below the surface layer. The surface layer must be encoded first, followed by the underlying layers.(c) Coral reef, which is always covered, represented as a surface (INT1 -- K16): An *Obstruction* feature of type surface must be encoded with attributes *category of obstruction* = _6_ (foul area), *nature of surface* = _14_ (coral) and *water level effect* = _3_ (always underwater/submerged). This feature must be covered by a *Depth Area* or *Unsurveyed Area* feature as appropriate. In this area, some point dangers may be shown. An *Underwater/Awash Rock* feature should be encoded for each individual point danger, with *nature of surface* = _14_ (coral).(d) Hard bottom: The attribute *nature of surface -- qualifying terms* = _10_ (hard) should be encoded, with the associated *nature of surface* populated with an empty (null) value.(e) On the source, in the intertidal area or along the drying line, the nature of surface is sometimes shown by an open line rather than a closed area. In such cases, a *Seabed Area* feature of type curve should be encoded, with attribute *water level effect* = _4_ (covers and uncovers).(f) If it is required to encode a rock pinnacle which is dangerous to navigation, it must be done using the feature *Underwater/Awash Rock*, while a rocky nature of seabed should be encoded using a *Seabed Area* feature.(g) Where a *Seabed Area* feature of type surface is located in an intertidal area, it should be encoded with *water level effect* = _4_ (covers and uncovers), in order for the intertidal rock or coral symbol to be displayed in ECDIS.

* The nature of the seabed should be shown in depths of 2000m and less. The nature of the seabed may be shown in greater depths if thought to be useful.

<<table_12-1>> below contains the most common encoding combinations of *nature of surface* and *nature of surface -- qualifying terms*; other coding combinations are possible.

[[sec_12.4.1]]
==== Sandwaves (see S-4 -- B-428.1)

Sandwave areas may be dangerous to Mariners, as the depth may be less than charted, because surveys are not necessarily conducted at the ideal time for sandwave building. Some research has shown that sandwave mobility is most evident in the vertical plane and high spots may occur on crest lines in response to calm weather, and possibly during particular times within the tidal cycle. It is therefore important to warn the Mariner of the presence of sandwaves, and provide them with as much information as is available and can be included in the ENC.

If it is required to encode sandwaves, this must be done using the feature *Sandwave*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The shifting nature of the seabed resulting from sandwave activity should be indicated on the underlying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* (see <<sec_3.8>>), using the attribute *category of temporal variation*.
* The attribute *vertical length* is used to populate the amplitude of the sandwave above the seafloor, where known.
* Care must be taken not to over-generalize depth depiction in sandwave areas, as the typically convoluted contour pattern, and significant depth changes between soundings selected from crests and troughs, help to draw attention to these features. However, this will not usually be sufficient warning, as the variance between crest and trough may fall between standard contours, or the optimum display scale for the ENC data may be insufficient to show the sandwaves individually, or anything but the shoalest soundings. Attention should therefore be drawn to the area by encoding a *Sandwave* feature. If considered necessary, the nature of any navigational hazard presented by the sandwaves may be incorporated using the complex attribute *information* (see <<sec_2.4.6>>).
* Where frequently repeated surveys show variations in least depth, the shoalest soundings obtained over a period of years should be encoded. This blending of details from surveys of differing dates must be done with care; in particular, long-term deepening must not be overlooked.
