==== Built-up areas (see S-4 -- B-370.3-4, B-370.6-7and B-370.9)

When representing built-up areas, the aim of the compiler must be
to create the correct impression of the extent of the built-up area.

If it is required to encode a built-up area, it must be done using
the feature *Built-Up Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* A built-up area crossed by curve features (for example roads, streets,
railways) should not be divided into multiple features, unless separate
sections of the built-up area have at least one different attribute
value.
* However, for presentation purposes, a built-up area of type surface
crossed by a river or canal of type surface must be divided into several
features, with the built-up area features not overlapping the river
or canal feature. A built-up area of type surface should not overlap
a lake, dock or lock basin feature of type surface.
* Several buildings or built-up areas may be referred to by the same
settlement, village or town name on the source. In such cases, the
individual buildings or built-up areas should be encoded as separate
unnamed features, using the features *Building* or *Built-Up Area*,
and additionally, an *Administration Area* feature (see <<sec_16.8>>)
covering the whole named area should be created with the name encoded
using the attribute *feature name*. The encoded *Administration Area*
feature should also have the attribute stem:[bb "jurisdiction" = 3]
(national sub-division).
* *Built-Up Area* should be covered by *Land Area* features of type
surface, or be coincident with *Land Area* features of type point.
* Where the source indicates that a built-up area extends into navigable
water (over *Depth Area* or *Unsurveyed Area* object(s)), the
*Built-Up Area* should be extended over the water area and the Boolean
attribute *in the water* must be set to _True_ to indicate that the
feature is to be included in the ECDIS Base Display. The actual coastline
should be encoded as *coastline*, having no value populated for
*category of coastline*. There is no requirement to split the
*Built-Up Area* into two separate features where it crosses the coastline;
or to encode the "apparent" coastline (seaward edge of the built-up
area). Underlying bathymetry (depth contours, soundings) may be encoded
as required. Exceptionally, encoders may extend the underlying
*Land Area* and *Coastline* features seaward to the "apparent" coastline.
This encoding should be considered for generalization purposes on
smaller scale ENCs. Where the built-up area extends over navigable
water it is not required to encode any supporting structures
(for example piles, stilts).
* For encoding individual buildings over navigable water, see <<sec_6.2.1>>.

==== Buildings (see S-4 -- B-325; B-328.1; B-362.2; B-370.3; B-370.5; B-372 and B-373.1-4)

Waterfront, landmark and some public buildings should be encoded precisely
and individually on the larger optimum display scale ENC data. When
representing buildings generally, forming urban and suburban areas,
villages, and other built-up areas, the aim of the compiler must be
to create the correct impression of the extent of the built-up area
and the density of the buildings.

Within built-up areas,only waterfront, landmark, and certain public
buildings of interest should be encoded individually.

Scattered buildings of no individual importance must be omitted when
more than about 1 mile (or 2 kilometres) inland. Nearer the shore
they may be generalised by encoding a few representative buildings,
sufficient to give the correct impression of building density.

Public buildings, with the possible exception of Post Offices and
Hospitals, are charted mainly as visual features or points of reference
ashore, not for their interest for particular functions. Except where
they could be useful landmarks for navigation, they should be encoded
only on largest optimum display scale ENC data.

Buildings constructed as places of worship often form significant
landmarks; their size and structure incorporating towers, spires,
cupolas, etc often render them conspicuous. These buildings when known
to be prominent or conspicuous should be encoded up to several miles
inland, with sufficient information to enable them to be easily identified.
When the optimum display scale for the ENC data permits, the building
should be encoded as a surface feature with attention being drawn
to any significant features (landmarks).

If it is required to encode a building (other than a landmark, tank,
silo or roofed structure erected or extending over navigable water),
it must be done using the feature *Building*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For landmarks, see <<sec_7.2>>; for silos, tanks and water towers,
see <<sec_7.3>>. For common encoding combinations, see <<sec_7.1>>.
For roofed structures such as boathouses erected or extending over
navigable water to provide protection for a vessel or its cargo, see
<<sec_8.7>>.
* The feature association *Structure/Equipment* (see <<sec_25.16>>)
must only be used with *Building* features if the main purpose of
the building is to act as an aid to navigation (for example a lighthouse).
* A ruined building should be encoded in the same way as the feature
in good condition, but with attribute stem:[bb "condition" = 2] (ruined).
* For an encoded *Building* feature located in navigable water, the
Boolean attribute *in the water* must be set to _True_ to indicate
that the feature is to be included in the ECDIS Base Display. Where
such structures are located in the water it is not required to encode
any supporting structures (for example piles, stilts).
* If it is required to encode vertical and/or horizontal clearances
and any other information relevant for allowing vessels to enter or
berth beneath/within the structure, this must be done by encoding
the structure using the feature *Structure Over Navigable Water* (see
<<sec_8.7>>).
* When a building is shown as a surface, indicating its true shape,
and it is required to encode a prominent feature such as a tower or
spire that is part of the structure, two features must be created
(see <<fig_6-1>> below):
** a *Building* feature of type surface for the main building,
** a *Landmark* feature of type point for the prominent feature.

[[fig_6-1]]
.Landmarks
image::figure-6-1.png[624,158]

* If available and considered important for route planning and/or
monitoring, the vertical uncertainty associated with encoded vertical
clearance values should also be encoded.

[[sec_6.2.2]]
==== Harbour offices (see S-4 -- B-325)

If it is required to encode a harbour office, it must be done using
a *Building* feature, with the attribute *function* taking at least
one of the values:_2_ - harbour-masters office_3_ - customs office_4_
- health office_11_ - pilot office

[[sec_6.2.3]]
==== Transit sheds and warehouses (see S-4 -- B-328.1)

If it is required to encode a transit shed or warehouse, it must be
done using a *Building* feature, with attributes stem:[bb "function"
= 15] (transit shed/warehouse), and if it is required, *feature name*
(*name*) = name or number of the shed.

==== Airfields (see S-4 -- B-366)

Airfields (or airports) within a few miles of the coast must be charted
on larger and medium optimum display scale ENC data; they are significant
to coastal navigation because of the many visual and audible features
associated with them and the related air traffic.

For ENC data at larger optimum display scales, an airport should be
encoded using a combination of the following features: *Airport/Airfield*
(surface), *Runway* (surface or curve), *Building* (surface or point)
and *Landmark* (surface or point). At least one *Airport/Airfield*
or *Runway* must be in this set of features.

For ENC data at smaller optimum display scales, an airport should
be encoded as an *Airport/Airfield* of type point.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If individual buildings are visually conspicuous, they must be encoded
as separate features.
* If it is required to encode the control tower, it must be done using
a *Landmark* feature, with attributes stem:[bb "function" = 39] (control)
and stem:[bb "category of landmark" = 17] (tower). If it is required
to encode other buildings, thismust be done using the feature *Building*.
* If it is required to encode a seaplane landing area, it must be
done using the feature *Seaplane Landing Area* (see <<sec_16.5>>).
* For navigational aids associated with air navigation, and air obstruction
lights, see clauses related to navigational aids.

==== Airfields (see S-4 -- B-366)

Airfields (or airports) within a few miles of the coast must be encoded
on large and medium optimum display scale ENC data; they are significant
to coastal navigation because of the many visual and audible features
associated with them and the related air traffic.

For larger optimum display scale ENC data, an airport should be encoded
using a combination of the following features: *Airport/Airfield*
(surface), *Runway* (surface or curve), *Building* (surface or point)
and *Landmark* (surface or point). At least one *Airport/Airfield*
or *Runway* must be in this set of features.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Two or more crossing runways may be encoded as one surface.
* If it is required to encode a seaplane landing area, it must be
done using the feature *Seaplane Landing Area* (see <<sec_16.5>>).
* For navigational aids associated with air navigation, and air obstruction
lights, see clauses related to navigational aids.

[[sec_6.6.1]]
==== Bridges (see S4 -- B-381)

If it is required to encode a bridge, it should be done using the
feature *Bridge*. Bridges may be encoded over water that is navigable
or non-navigable at the optimum display scale of the ENC data. Where
the bridge is encoded over navigable water, associated features such
as spans, pylons and pontoons of the bridge must be associated with
the *Bridge* feature using the association *Bridge Aggregation*
(see <<sec_25.4>>) (that is, the *Bridge* feature has geometry of
type curve or surface, or has no geometry). Where the bridge is encoded
over non-navigable water, then it must be encoded, where required,
using a *Bridge* feature having no component features (that is, the
*Bridge* feature has geometry of type curve or surface); or as a *Landmark*
feature (see <<sec_7.2>>) if the bridge has geometry of type point.

The value of the vertical clearance between (high) water level and
any fixed overhead obstruction must always be given, where known,
on the largest optimum display scale ENC data intended for navigation
under the bridge, and for detailed passage planning. The datum above
which clearances are given must be a high water level, preferably
Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT), where the tide is appreciable. For
bridges over navigable water, the value for the vertical clearance(s)
must be encoded using the features *Span Fixed* or *Span Opening*
(see <<sec_6.7;and!sec_6.8>>), with the clearance(s) populated using
the complex attributes *vertical clearance fixed*,
*vertical clearance closed* and/or *vertical clearance open*, and
sub-attributes populated relevant to the span. In areas where the
tidal range is not appreciable the datum above which clearances are
given should be Mean Sea Level (MSL).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode the name of a bridge over navigable
water, the *Bridge* should be encoded using geometry of type curve
or surface, associated with all relevant components of the bridge
using the association *Bridge Aggregation*. The extent of the geometry
of the *Bridge* should utilise the geometry of all the components
of the bridge so as to cover its full extent.
* If it is required to encode the extent of an unnamed bridge over
navigable water, this may be done using a *Bridge* feature having
no geometry, associated with all relevant components of the bridge
using the association *Bridge Aggregation*.
* Water under a bridge must be encoded using the features *Depth Area*,
*Dredged Area* or *Unsurveyed Area* (and appropriate *Depth Contour*
and *Sounding* features) if the waterway is navigable at the optimum
display scale for the ENC data, or using the feature *Land Area* if
the waterway is not navigable at the optimum display scale for the
ENC data.
* When there is a fixed vertical clearance, closed vertical clearance,
or open vertical clearance given for a bridge, it should be applied
only to the portion of the bridge to which the clearance refers, using
the features *Span Fixed* or *Span Opening* (see <<sec_6.7;and!sec_6.8>>).
All encoded bridge spans must be associated with the *Bridge* feature
using the association *Bridge Aggregation* (see <<sec_25.4>>). See
examples in the Figures below. If there are no vertical clearances
given for a bridge and it is over water that is navigable at the optimum
display scale of the ENC data, a single *Span Fixed* or *Span Opening*
feature must be encoded covering the area of the bridge, having mandatory
vertical clearance attributes populated with an empty (null) value.
* The attribute *height* is used, where required, to encode the height
of the highest point on the bridge structure (see <<sec_2.5.7>>).
* If it is required to encode a bridge for which part or the entire
span is moved aside or backwards, it must be done using a *Bridge*
feature, with attributes *opening bridge* = _True_ and
stem:[bb "category of opening bridge" = 7] (drawbridge).
* If it is required to encode a pontoon bridge where a pontoon section
may be temporarily removed or rotated so as to allow passage of vessels,
this must be done using a *Bridge* feature, with attributes
stem:[bb "bridge construction" = 3] (pontoon bridge),
stem:[bb "opening bridge" = "True"] and
stem:[bb "category of opening bridge" = 3] (swing bridge).
* If it is required to encode a distance mark that is included on
or associated with a bridge, this must be done using the feature
*Distance Mark* (see <<sec_8.10>>).
* In navigable water, bridge supports must be encoded, where possible,
using a *Pylon/Bridge Support* feature (see <<sec_6.12>>), with attribute
stem:[bb "category of pylon" = 4] (bridge/pylon tower) or _5_
(bridge pier); or if the bridge is a pontoon bridge as *Pontoon* features
(see <<sec_8.19>>).
* It is not mandatory to encode roads or railways on bridges.

[[sec_6.7.1]]
==== Span fixed

If it is required to encode the clearance characteristics (vertical
or horizontal) for any fixed part of a bridge between piers or supports,
it must be done using the feature *Span Fixed*, which must be associated
with the feature *Bridge* (see <<sec_6.6>>) using the association
*Bridge Aggregation* (see <<sec_25.4>>). See <<sec_6.6>>for examples
of *Span Fixed* features aggregated to *Bridge*.

The value of the vertical clearance between (high) water level and
any fixed overhead obstruction must always be given, where known,
on the largest optimum display scale ENC data intended for navigation
under the overhead obstruction, and for detailed passage planning.
The datum above which clearances are given must be a high water level,
preferably Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT), where the tide is appreciable.
Clearances must be populated using the complex attribute
*vertical clearance fixed* and sub-attributes populated relevant to
the feature, rounded down to the nearest whole metre (unless under
10m, when metres and decimetres may be quoted). In areas where the
tidal range is not appreciable the datum above which clearances are
given should be Mean Sea Level (MSL).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* *Span Fixed* features should only be encoded if the span is entirely
or partly over navigable water at the optimum display scale for the
ENC data.
* Where the optimum display scale of the ENC data is such that individual
spans on a fixed bridge over navigable water cannot be indicated,
the entire bridge should be covered by a single *Span Fixed* feature,
having attributes populated according to the most navigationally important
span.
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable
to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the
reference datum for vertical clearances in tidal waters.
* Where encoded, an associated instance of the cartographic feature
*Text Placement* (see <<sec_23.1>>) relates to the positioning of
the vertical and/or horizontal clearances for the span, where encoded.

* If available and considered important for route planning and/or
monitoring, the vertical uncertainty associated with encoded vertical
clearance values should also be encoded.

==== Span opening

If it is required to encode the clearance characteristics (vertical
or horizontal) for an opening part of a bridge between piers or supports,
it must be done using the feature *Span Opening*, which must be associated
with the feature *Bridge* (see <<sec_6.6>>) using the association
*Bridge Aggregation* (see <<sec_25.4>>). See <<sec_6.6>>for examples
of *Span Opening* features used in conjunction with *Bridge* features.

The value of the vertical clearance between (high) water level and
any opening overhead obstruction must always be given, where known,
on the largest optimum display scale ENC data intended for navigation
under the overhead obstruction, and for detailed passage planning.
The datum above which clearances are given must be a high water level,
preferably Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT), where the tide is appreciable.
Clearances must be populated using the complex attributes
*vertical clearance closed* and *vertical clearance open* for the
span and sub-attributes populated relevant to the feature, rounded
down to the nearest whole metre (unless under 10m, when metres and
decimetres may be quoted). In areas where the tidal range is not appreciable
the datum above which clearances are given should be Mean Sea Level
(MSL).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* *Span Opening* features should only be encoded if the span is entirely
or partly over navigable water at the optimum display scale for the
ENC data.
* Where the optimum display scale of the ENC data is such that individual
spans over navigable water cannot be indicated, the entire bridge
should be covered by a single *Span Opening* feature, having attributes
populated according to the opening span.

* The complex attributes *vertical clearance closed* and
*vertical clearance open* must be encoded for both the opening
(vertical open) and closed (vertical closed) clearance values.
Where the open vertical clearance is unlimited, the Boolean sub-attribute
*vertical clearance unlimited* must be set to _True_.
* Where it is required to encode time schedule information relating
to the opening and closing times for the span, including any scheduled
closure times or amended schedules for festivals or national holidays,
this should be done using an associated instance of the information
types *Service Hours* (see <<sec_24.2>>) and/or
*Non-Standard Working Day* (see <<sec_24.3>>).
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable
to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the
reference datum for vertical clearances in tidal waters.
* Where encoded, an associated instance of the cartographic feature
*Text Placement* (see <<sec_23.1>>) relates to the positioning of
the vertical and/or horizontal clearances for the span, where encoded.

* If available and considered important for route planning and/or
monitoring, the vertical uncertainty associated with encoded vertical
clearance values should also be encoded.

==== Overhead cables (see S-4 -- B-382)

If it is required to encode an overhead cable, it must be done using
the feature *Cable Overhead*.

The value of the vertical clearance between (high) water level and
any fixed overhead obstruction must always be given, where known,
on the largest optimum display scale ENC data intended for navigation
under the obstruction, and for detailed passage planning. The datum
above which clearances are given must be a high water level, preferably
Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT), where the tide is appreciable. The
value for the vertical clearance must be encoded using the complex
attributes *vertical clearance fixed* or *vertical clearance safe*,
and sub-attributes populated relevant to the feature, rounded down
to the nearest whole metre (unless under 10m, when metres and decimetres
may be quoted). In areas where the tidal range is not appreciable
the datum above which clearances are given should be Mean Sea Level
(MSL).

For power cables or transmission lines carrying very high voltages,
an additional vertical clearance of from 2 to 5 metres may be needed
to avoid an electrical discharge. When known, the authorised safe
clearance (known as the safe vertical clearance), which is the physical
clearance minus a safety margin, must be populated using
*vertical clearance safe*, having the sub-attribute
*vertical clearance value* populated with the safe clearance value.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode telepheric cables, this must be done
using *Conveyor* features (see <<sec_6.8>>), with attribute
stem:["CATCON" = 1] (aerial cableway).
* Where a cable has radar reflectors at known positions, they must
be encoded as separate *Radar Reflector* features (see <<sec_20.18>>).
If the whole cable is radar conspicuous, the optimum display scale
for the ENC data is too small to show individual reflectors, or the
positions of the radar reflectors are not known, the *Cable Overhead*
should be encoded with attribute *radar conspicuous*.
* In navigable water, overhead cable supports must be encoded, where
possible, using a *Pylon/Bridge Support* feature (see <<sec_6.12>>),
with attribute *category of pylon* = _1_ or _2_.
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable
to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the
reference datum for vertical clearances in tidal waters.

* If available and considered important for route planning and/or
monitoring, the vertical uncertainty associated with encoded vertical
clearance values should also be encoded.

[[sec_6.11.1]]
==== Overhead pipelines (see S-4 -- B-383)

If it is required to encode an overhead pipeline passing over or nearby
navigable waters, it must be done using the feature *Pipeline Overhead*.

The value of the vertical clearance between (high) water level and
any fixed overhead obstruction must always be given, where known,
on the largest optimum display scale ENC data intended for navigation
under the obstruction, and for detailed passage planning. The datum
above which clearances are given must be a high water level, preferably
Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT), where the tide is appreciable.
The value for the vertical clearance must be encoded using the complex
attribute *vertical clearance fixed*, and sub-attributes populated
relevant to the feature, rounded down to the nearest whole metre
(unless under 10m, when metres and decimetres may be quoted). In areas
where the tidal range is not appreciable the datum above which clearances
are given should be Mean Sea Level (MSL).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Where an overhead pipeline is disused, it should be encoded with
the attribute stem:[bb "status" = 4] (not in use), and the attributes
*category of pipe* and *product* must not be encoded.
* Where a pipeline has radar reflectors at known positions, they must
be encoded as separate *Radar Reflector* features (see <<sec_20.18>>).
If the whole pipeline is radar conspicuous, the optimum display scale
for the ENC data is too small to show individual reflectors, or the
positions of the radar reflectors are not known, the *Pipeline Overhead*
should be encoded with attribute *radar conspicuous*.
* In navigable water, overhead pipeline supports must be encoded,
where possible, using a *Pylon/Bridge Support* feature (see <<sec_6.12>>),
with attribute stem:[bb "category of pylon" = 6] (pipeline pylon).
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable
to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the
reference datum for vertical clearances in tidal waters.

* If available and considered important for route planning and/or
monitoring, the vertical uncertainty associated with encoded vertical
clearance values should also be encoded.

==== Railways (see S-4 -- B-328.4 and B-362)

In urbanized areas, depiction of railways within some miles of the
coast is part of the ENC's function in giving a general indication
of the degree of land development. In largely undeveloped areas, the
depiction of railways to isolated ports draws attention to such ports
and may be of some maritime interest for transport purposes. Railways
should be encoded on larger and medium optimum display scale ENC data.

Where railways run just inshore of the coast, or down to it, together
with associated bridges, signal posts and other structure, they provide
essential identification features. It should not generally be necessary
to depict the smaller associated features - posts, gantries etc.

If it is required to encode a railway, it must be done using the feature
*Railway*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode a railway station, it must be done using
a *Building* feature, with attribute stem:[bb "function" = 8] (railway
station). On the largest optimum display scale ENC data, the names
of railway terminals or main stations may be populated using the attribute
*feature name* for the *Building*.
* Abandoned railways (those which are mostly still intact) should
be encoded, if required, as *Railway* with the attribute
stem:[bb "status" = 4] (not in use).

==== Roads and tracks (see S-4 -- B-365)

On the largest optimum display scale continuous coastal series of
ENCs, and larger optimum display scale ENC data, all roads and tracks
running down to the coastline should be encoded where the optimum
display scale permits. Particular attention must be given to local
roads serving minor piers, boat hards and landings. Inland, major
roads within a few miles of the coast should be encoded to give a
general indication of the degree of development, but tracks and all
or some of the minor roads should be omitted. In largely undeveloped
areas, with very few roads, it may be desirable to encode even minor
roads inland.

On smaller optimum display scale ENC data, roads must be omitted.

If it is required to encode a road or track, it must be done using
the feature *Road*.

==== Tunnels (see S-4 -- B-363.1)

If it is required to encode a tunnel, it must be done using the feature
*Tunnel*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If there is a waterway inside the tunnel, and the waterway is navigable
at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, it must be encoded
as if it were a navigable canal (see <<sec_8.9.1>>), using the features
*Depth Area* or *Dredged Area* in conjunction with the *Tunnel* feature.
There must be no *Land Area* feature in the area covering the waterway.
* If it is required to encode a waterway inside a tunnel that is not
navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, it must be
done using the feature *Canal* (see <<sec_8.9>>) in conjunction with
the *Tunnel* feature. A *Land Area* feature must cover the tunnel.
The complex attributes *horizontal clearance fixed* and
*vertical clearance fixed* mustnot be encoded on the *Tunnel* feature
in this case.
* If it is required to encode a tunnel that has no waterway inside
it (but a railway, road etc), only the *Tunnel* feature must be encoded
(the section of railway or road inside the tunnel must not be encoded),
covered by *Land Area*, *Depth Area*, *Dredged Area* or
*Unsurveyed Area* features as appropriate. The complex attributes
*horizontal clearance fixed* and *vertical clearance fixed* must not
be encoded on the *Tunnel* feature in this case.
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable
to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the
reference datum for vertical clearances in tidal waters.

* If available and considered important for route planning and/or
monitoring, the vertical uncertainty associated with encoded vertical
clearance values should also be encoded.

[underline]#Distinction:# Railway; Road.
