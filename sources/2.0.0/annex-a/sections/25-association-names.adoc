== Association Names

The following diagrams are examples to demonstrate the structure of
the feature/feature and feature/information association tables
included in the following clauses, as they may be correspondingly
represented in UML. The examples are taken from the UML Relationship
Diagram for the feature *Two Way Route Part*. The complete
relationship diagram is shown in <<fig_25-1>> below.

[NOTE,keep-separate=true]
====
The association *Spatial Association* (see <<sec_25.15>>) is not
included in <<fig_25-1>> above, as this association identifies the
relationship between an information type (*Spatial Quality*) and the
spatial type to which a feature is bound (that is, the geometry to
which the feature is bound, rather than the feature itself).
====

The tables included in this Section are structured such that each row
of the table shows all components of the relationship as they would
be included at the association end for the entries included in the
"Associated With" column. For example, for the *Two Way Route* end of
the *Two-Way Route Aggregation* association (indicated by the red
outline included in <<fig_25-1>> above), the "Role Type" is
_Aggregation_; the "Role" is _The Collection_; and the "Multiplicity"
is _0,1_ (see <<sec_25.19>>):

|===
h| Role Type h| Role h| Associated With h| Multiplicity
| Aggregation | The Collection | *Two-Way Route* | 0,1

|===

Within the tables, features are grouped in separate table entries
where the features included at either end of the relationship may
differ for the association. For example <<table_25-2>>
footnote:[<<table_25-2>> is derived from <<sec_25.1>>.] below shows
that, for the feature/information association *Additional
Information*, the feature *Anchor Berth* may be associated with any
of the information types *Contact Details*, *Non-Standard Working
Day*, *Service Hours* or *Nautical Information*; while the feature
*Two Way Route Part* may only be associated with the information type
*Nautical Information* (as shown in <<fig_25-1>> above and
<<fig_25-5>>).

4+a| [underline]#IHO Definition:# *TWO-WAY-ROUTE AGGREGATION*.
A feature association for the binding between a two-way route and
its component features.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* A *Two-Way Route Aggregation* must, if required, include at least
one *Two-Way Route Part* feature associated to a *Two-Way Route*
feature.
* The *Two-Way Route* may additionally be associated to the aids to
navigation marking the components of the Route using the association
*Aids to Navigation Association* (see <<sec_25.2>>).

h| Role Type h| Role h| Associated With h| Multiplicity
| Aggregation | The Collection | *Two-Way Route* | 0,1
| Association | The Component | *Two-Way Route Part* | 1,*

|===

In <<fig_25-3>> above, the table should be interpreted as follows:

* A *Two-Way Route* instance, if it exists, _aggregates_ (or is the
container for)_the collection_ of one or more *Two-Way Route Part*
features.
* A *Two-Way Route Part* instance is _the_ __component__ (or is a
containee) of a *Two-Way Route* feature, if the *Two-Way Route
Aggregation* association is created.
* The _1,++*++_ multiplicity at the *Two-Way Route Part* end of the
relationship indicates that, where a *Two-Way Route Aggregation*
exists, there must be to at least one *Two-Way Route Part* feature
included in the *Two-Way Route Aggregation*.

NOTE: This does not mean that all encoded instances of *Two-Way Route
Part* must be included in a *Two-Way Route Aggregation* (see next
bullet).

* The _0,1_ multiplicity at the *Two-Way Route* end of the
relationship indicates that there is no requirement to bind each
*Two-Way Route Part* feature to an instance of *Two-Way Route* using
a *Two-Way Route Aggregation* (due to the lower multiplicity being
zero). However, where the relationship exists, there must be exactly
one *Two-Way Route* feature included in the association.

<<fig_25-4>> below shows the representation of the feature/feature
association *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* for the *Two-Way
Route Part* feature (see <<sec_25.19>>).

4+a| [underline]#IHO Definition:# *TRAFFIC SPARATION SCHEME AGGREGATION*.
A feature association for the binding between a Traffic Separation
Scheme or a Traffic Separation Scheme System and its component features.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* A *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* must, if required,
include at least one of any of the features shown in the "The
Component" role below in upright text associated to a *Traffic
Separation Scheme* feature.
* The *Traffic Separation Scheme* may additionally be associated to
the aids to navigation marking the components of the Scheme using the
association *Aids to Navigation Association* (see <<sec_25.2>>).

h| Role Type h| Role h| Associated With h| Multiplicity
| Aggregation | The Collection | *Traffic Separation Scheme* | 0,1

*Deep Water Route Centreline*, *Deep Water Route Part*,

*Separation Zone or Line*, *Traffic Separation Scheme*,
*Traffic Separation Scheme Boundary*, *Traffic Separation Scheme Crossing*,
*Traffic Separation Scheme Lane Part*,
*Traffic Separation Scheme Roundabout*, *Two-Way Route*,
*Two-Way Route Part* | 0,*

|===

The components of the feature/feature association *Traffic Separation
Scheme Aggregation* should be interpreted as for the corresponding
components of the feature/feature association *Two-Way Route
Aggregation* described for <<fig_25-3>>, except for the multiplicity
at the *Two-Way Route Part* end of the association (indicated with
the arrow in <<fig_25-4>>). The multiplicity as indicated in the UML
as "0..++*++ {1..++*++ [C]}" in this case is an example of
"collective multiplicity" notation. Collective multiplicities are
described in the following clauses in the Remarks section of the
tables.

* A collective multiplicity can only exist when there is more than
one feature type that may be used in a given role. A collective
multiplicity indicates the multiplicity of the collection.
* The "0..*" component of the multiplicity shown in the UML in this
example is the "individual multiplicity". An individual multiplicity
indicates the multiplicity for each component of the collection, and
in this example indicates that that none of the listed features are
required to be included.
* The collective component of the multiplicity ({1..++*++ [C]} in the
UML) indicates that where the association *Traffic Separation Scheme
Aggregation* exists, there must be at least one of any of the
features (collectively) that may be included as "containees". The
allowable list of features is included in the following table
entries, noting in this example that at least one instance of
*Two-Way Route Part* is allowable, if required, for the *Traffic
Separation Scheme Aggregation* (as highlighted in <<fig_25-4>>).
* The individual component of the multiplicity (0,*) indicates there
is no requirement for a *Two-Way Route Part* feature (or any other
feature in the list) to be included in a *Traffic Separation Scheme
Aggregation* (due to the lower multiplicity being zero). However
where the relationship exists, there may be an unlimited number of
*Two-Way Route Part* features or any other feature included in the
list (due to the upper multiplicity being "*").
* Upright style (non-italicized) features in the tables are members
of the collective multiplicity, italicized features are not. The
individual multiplicity applies to all listed features; the
collective multiplicity only applies to the upright features, which
may or may not comprise the entire list.

The Tables in this Section show only the individual multiplicity in
the "Multiplicity" column. The indication of collective multiplicity
is included in the Remarks (in <<fig_25-4>> above, the Remark "A
*Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* must, if required, include at
least one of any of the features shown in the "The Component" role
below in upright text associated to a *Traffic Separation Scheme*
feature" indicates the collective multiplicity).

<<fig_25-5>> below shows the representation of the
feature/information association *Additional Information* for the
*Two-Way Route Part* feature (table derived from <<sec_25.1>>).

4+a| [underline]#IHO Definition:# *ADDITIONAL INFORMATION*.
A feature association for the binding between at least one instance
of a geo feature and an instance of an information type.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The features comprising an *Additional Information* association
must, if required, include at least one of any of the geo features
included in the following list associated to one or more of the
corresponding information types included in the "The Information"
role.

h| Role Type h| Role h| Associated With h| Multiplicity

*Unsurveyed Area*, *Vegetation*, *Virtual AIS Aid to Navigation*,
*Water Turbulence*, *Waterfall*, *Weed/Kelp*, *Wreck*
| 0,*

|===

The only additional characteristic to note in <<fig_25-5>>, which is
characteristic of all feature/information associations, is that
unlike feature/feature associations, feature/information associations
have only one role (at the information feature end of the
relationship).

Within the feature tables included in <<sec_3;to!sec_24>> of this
document, a description of the associations as relevant to each
individual feature has also been included. <<table_25-6>> below shows
an example as included for the feature *Lateral Buoy* (see
<<sec_20.1>>); and guidance as to how to interpret these tables.

Each row included in <<table_25-6>> above describes a S-101
association instance that may be created and include one or more
instances of the feature type *Lateral Buoy* as a member; and is
structured such that all components of the association are grouped as
they would appear at the end of the association containing *Lateral
Buoy* (see <<fig_25-1>> and associated guidance).

. The name of the association as specified in the following clauses.
. The list of features that *Lateral Buoy* may be associated to for
the association (in UML terms, the list of features at the "other
end" of the association).
. The type of association as defined for the *Lateral Buoy* end of
the association -- "Association", "Aggregation" or "Composition" as
described in S-100 Part 1, clause 1-4.9; and included in the tables
in this Section in the "Role Type" column.
+
--
NOTE: The association type for a feature/information association will
always be "Association".
--

. The role name as defined for the *Lateral Buoy* end of the
association and as described in <<sec_26>>; and included in the
tables in this Section in the "Role" column.
+
--
NOTE: a dash "-" in this column indicates the one-way nature of a
feature/information association -- the role name is included at the
information end of the association only.
--

. The multiplicity as defined for the *Lateral Buoy* end of the
association and included in the tables in this Section in the
"Multiplicity" column. For *Lateral Buoy*, these multiplicities are
interpreted as follows:

* 0,1 for the *Structure/Equipment* association means that a *Lateral
Buoy* can exist in isolation (lower multiplicity 0) but, if the
association exists, exactly one instance of *Lateral Buoy* must be
included in the "The Structure" role of type Composition. The same
principle applies for the *Text Association* association.
* 0,* means that a *Lateral Buoy* can exist in isolation (lower
multiplicity 0) but, if the association exists, one or more instances
of *Lateral Buoy* may (but are not required) to be included in the
association. In general this is an indication of "collective
multiplicity" (see <<fig_15-4>> above and associated guidance).
