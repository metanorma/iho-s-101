[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode an offshore landmark (as defined by the attribute *category of landmark*), the ECDIS system attribute *in the water* (see <<sec_30.2>>) must be populated to ensure the feature is always displayed on the ECDIS. Where fitted, lights should be encoded as described in <<sec_19>>, with the *Building*, *Wind Turbine*, *Landmark* or *Silo/Tank* being used as the structure feature for the relevant light equipment feature(s) (see <<sec_18.1>>).
* For encoding wind turbines, see <<sec_7.4>>.

[NOTE]
--
The attribute *colour pattern* is mandatory for landmarks that have more than one value populated for the attribute *colour*.

Complex attribute *feature name*, sub-attribute *name usage* is mandatory if the name is intended to be displayed when display of names is enabled by the Mariner. See <<sec_2.5.8>>.

For each instance of *information*, at least one of the sub-attributes *file reference* or *text* must be populated.

[[sec_7.2.1]]
==== Buildings, landmarks, tanks, silos (see S-4 -- B-373; B-373.6; B-374.3-5; B-374.7; B-375.1-2; B-456.2; B-487.3)

Depending on height and the topographic relief, structures considered to be landmarks should be encoded up to several miles inland.

Waterfront, landmark and some public buildings should be encoded precisely and individually on the larger optimum display scale ENC data. When representing buildings generally, including urban and other built-up areas, the aim of the compiler must be to create the correct impression of the extent of the built-up area and the density of the buildings.

If it is required to encode a landmark (other than a tank, silo or roofed structure erected or extending over navigable water), it must be done using the feature *Landmark*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For buildings, see <<sec_6.2>>; for silos, tanks and water towers, see <<sec_7.3>>. For common encoding combinations, see <<sec_7.1>>. For wind turbines, see <<sec_7.4>>. For roofed structures such as boathouses erected or extending over navigable water to provide protection for a vessel or its cargo, see <<sec_8.7>>. For flare stacks on offshore platforms, see <<sec_14.1.1>>.
* The feature association *Structure/Equipment* (see <<sec_25.16>>) must only be used with *Landmark* features if the main purpose of the structure is to act as an aid to navigation (for example a lighthouse).
* A water tower must be encoded, where required, using the feature *Silo/Tank* (see <<sec_7.3>>).
* A ruined landmark should be encoded in the same way as the feature in good condition, but with attribute stem:[bb "condition" = 2] (ruined).
* Radio and television masts and towers are likely to be visible over long distances and should be encoded as landmarks, even when well inland. They will usually carry air obstruction lights.
* To aid identification of landmarks by the Mariner it may be useful to add the height of the top of the structure above ground level (*vertical length*) or above the general height datum (*height*).
* Buildings constructed as places of worship often form significant landmarks; their size and structure incorporating towers, spires, cupolas, etc often render them conspicuous. These buildings when known to be prominent or conspicuous should be encoded up to several miles inland (see <<fig_7-1>> below, examples (a) and (b)).
* The attribute *category of special purpose mark* should only be used if the *Landmark* is used as the front or rear lead for a transit, clearing line or measured distance, or for a leading line. Values for *category of special purpose mark* such as _16_ (leading mark), _17_ (measured distance mark) or _41_ (clearing mark) in particular should be used for these purposes.
* Values *category of landmark* = _26_ (bridge) and _27_ (dam) must only be used if the feature is encoded using point geometry; and must not be encoded over navigable water. Bridges and dams encoded using curve or surface geometry must be encoded using features *Bridge* (see <<sec_6.6>>) and *Dam* (see <<sec_8.12>>) respectively.
* For landmarks located in navigable water, the Boolean attribute *in the water* must be set to _True_ to indicate that the feature is to be included in the ECDIS Base Display. Where such structures are located in the water it is not required to encode any supporting structures (for example piles).
* When a building is shown as a surface, indicating its true shape, and it is required to encode a prominent feature such as a tower or spire that is part of the structure, two features must be created (see <<fig_7-1>> (b) below):
- a *Building* feature of type surface for the main building,

[[fig_7-1]]
.Landmarks
image::figure-7-1.png[Shape21,624,183]

- a *Landmark* feature of type point for the prominent feature.

* Not all landmarks are visually conspicuous. If a feature is visually conspicuous (that is, it is distinctly and noticeably visible from seaward), the attribute *visual prominence* must be encoded (see S-4 -- B-340).

==== Tanks, silos (see S-4 -- B-340.2 and B-376)

Isolated tanks or gasholders may be good landmarks and should be represented true to scale (that is, as surface) where possible, to enable them to be used as fixing marks. Groups of tanks, as at a refinery, may be useful for general identification of position but cannot usually be used for precise position-fixing because of uncertainty of the location of individual tanks.

If it is required to encode a tank or silo, it must be done using the feature *Silo/Tank*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For buildings, see <<sec_6.2>>; for landmarks, see <<sec_7.2>>. For common encoding combinations, see <<sec_7.1>>. For roofed structures such as boathouses erected or extending over navigable water to provide protection for a vessel or its cargo, see <<sec_8.7>>.
* Groups of silos or tanks (tank farm) in close proximity must be encoded, where required, using the feature *Production/Storage Area* (see <<sec_7.6>>). Individual, visually conspicuous silos, or tanks within a tank farm, may be encoded as *Silo/Tank* within the *Production/Storage Area*. Multiple silos contained within a single structure may be indicated using the complex attribute *multiplicity of features*.
* For tanks or silos located in or over navigable water, the Boolean attribute *in the water* must be set to _True_ to indicate that the feature is to be included in the ECDIS Base Display. Where such structures are located in the water it is not required to encode any supporting structures (for example piles).

==== Wind turbines (see S-4 -- B-374.6; B-445.8-9)

Wind turbinesare generally tall, multi-bladed structures, usually with two or three blades, which may pose as obstacles to navigation if located offshore but are often visible over long distances and therefore useful as visual references. Their purpose is to generate electricity for large communities, or to feed a national grid. They are often in groups (known as wind farms). Floating wind turbinesare held in position by ground tackle and consequently may be subject to significant lateral and some vertical movement.

If it is required to encode a wind turbine, it must be done using the feature *Wind Turbine*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The attribute *elevation* is only applicable for wind turbines on land.
* To aid identification of wind turbines on land by the Mariner it may be useful to add the height of the top of the structure above ground level (*vertical length*) or above the general height datum (*height*).
* For offshore wind turbines, the Boolean attribute *in the water* must be set to _True_ to indicate that the feature is to be included in the ECDIS Base Display. Where such structures are located in the water it is not required to encode any supporting structures (for example piles).
* For offshore wind turbines (attribute *in the water* = _True_), the attribute *height* is only relevant for fixed turbines, and is referred to the vertical datum (see <<sec_2.5.7>>).
* For offshore wind turbines, the attribute *vertical length* is only relevant for floating wind turbines, and is referred to the sea level.
* A ruined wind turbine should be encoded in the same way as the feature in good condition, but with attribute stem:[bb "condition" = 4] (wingless).
* If it is required to encode sites of dismantled offshore wind turbines, this must be done using *Foul Ground* features (see <<sec_13.7>>), unless the source indicates that any remaining structure protrudes far enough above the seabed so as to be an obstruction to surface navigation, in which case this must be encoded using an *Obstruction* feature (see <<sec_13.6>>).
* If it is required to encode an offshore wind farm, it must be done using the feature *Offshore Production Area* (see <<sec_14.6>>). An onshore wind farm must be encoded, where required, using the feature *Production/Storage Area* (see <<sec_7.6>>).
* Wind turbines may carry lights (see <<sec_19>>) or fog signals (see <<sec_20.19>>). Where fitted, lights should be encoded as described in <<sec_19>>, with the *Wind Turbine* being used as the structure feature for the light equipment feature(s).
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the reference datum for vertical clearances in tidal waters.

* If available and considered important for route planning and/or monitoring, the vertical uncertainty associated with encoded vertical clearance values should also be encoded.

* For encoding offshore safety zones around offshore wind turbines, see <<sec_14.1.3>>.

==== Fortified structures (see S-4 -- B-379)

Some coastlines have prominent defensive structures, often disused, decayed, or used for non-defence purposes. Such structures range from major castles and forts to minor lookout posts and may be the main distinctive features of headlands or stretches of coastline. National regulations permitting, any such features as are likely to be visible from seaward and should be encoded on the largest optimum display scale ENC data.

If it is required to encode a fortified structure, it must be done using the feature *Fortified Structure*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode a Martello tower, it must be done using *Fortified Structure* with attribute stem:[bb "category of fort" = 5] (fortified tower).
* Where fitted, lights should be encoded as described in <<sec_19>>, with the *Fortified Structure* being used as the structure feature for the relevant light equipment feature(s) (see <<sec_18.1>>).
* For fortified structures located in navigable water, the Boolean attribute *in the water* must be set to _True_ to indicate that the feature is to be included in the ECDIS Base Display. Where such structures are located in the water it is not required to encode any supporting structures (for example piles).

==== Production and storage areas (see S-4 -- B-328.2; B-367; B-374.6)

Production or storage areas located in close proximity to the coast are often prominent landmarks used by Mariners to assist in position-fixing. Features such as quarry faces, stockpiles, power stations, refineries, timber stacks in timber yards, factories, groups of tanks, groups of wind turbines, and slag heaps should be shown on the largest optimum display scale ENC data.

If it is required to encode production or storage area, it must be done using the feature *Production/Storage Area*.
