=== Terms, definitions and abbreviations

[[sec_1.3.1]]
==== Use of language

Within this document:

* "Must" indicates a mandatory requirement.
* "Should" indicates an optional requirement, that is the recommended
process to be followed, but is not mandatory.
* "May" means "allowed to" or "could possibly", and is not mandatory.

[[sec_1.3.2]]
==== Terms and definitions

==== Accuracy

Closeness of agreement between a test result and the accepted reference
values.

NOTE: A test result can be from an observation or measurement.

==== Aggregation

Special form of {{Association,association}} that specifies a whole-part
relationship between the aggregate (whole) and a component part
(see {{Composition,composition}}).

==== Alarm

(MSC.302/A) a high-priority {{Alert,alert}}. Condition requiring immediate
attention and action by the bridge team, to maintain the safe navigation
of the ship.

==== Alert

(MSC.302/A) announcement of abnormal situations and conditions requiring
attention. Alerts are divided in four priorities:
{{Emergency Alarm,emergency alarms}}, {{Alarm,alarms}}, {{Warning,warnings}}
and {{Caution,cautions}}. An alert provides information about a defined
state change in connection with information about how to announce
this event in a defined way to the system and the operator.

==== Application Schema

Conceptual schema for data required by one or more applications.

==== Association

Semantic relationship between two or more classifiers that specifies
connections among their {{Instance,instances}}.

NOTE: A binary association is an association among exactly two classifiers
(including the possibility of an association from a classifier to itself)

==== Attribute

. Named property of an entity.
+
--
NOTE: Describes a geometrical, topological, thematic, or other characteristic
of an entity.
--

. Feature within a classifier that describes a range of values that
{{Instance,instances}} of the classifier may hold.
+
--
NOTE: An attribute is semantically equivalent to a composition association;
however, the intent and usage is normally different.

NOTE: "Feature" used in this definition is the UML meaning of the
term.
--

==== Boundary

Set that represents the limit of an entity.

NOTE: Boundary is most commonly used in the context of geometry, where
the set is a collection of points or a collection of objects that
represent those points.

==== Caution

(MSC.302/A) lowest priority of an {{Alert,alert}}. Awareness of a
condition which does not warrant an {{Alarm,alarm}} or warning condition,
but still requires attention out of the ordinary consideration of
the situation or of given information.

==== Class

Description of a set of objects that share the same {{Attribute,attributes}},
operations, methods, {{Relationship,relationships}}, and semantics.

NOTE: A class represents a concept within the system being modelled.
Depending on the kind of model, the concept may be real-world
(for an analysis model), or it may also contain algorithmic and computer
implementation concepts (for a design model). A classifier is a generalization
of class that includes other class-like elements, such as data type,
actor and component.

==== Classification

The process of determining the appropriate {{Data Type,data type}}
within a {{Feature Catalogue,feature catalogue}} for a particular
real world feature, including consideration of
{{Data Quality,data quality}}.

==== Composition

Form of {{Aggregation,aggregation}} {{Association,association}} with
strong ownership and coincident lifetime as part of the whole.

NOTE: Parts with non-fixed multiplicity may be created after the composite
itself, but once created they live and die with it (that is, they
share lifetimes). Such parts can also be explicitly removed before
the death of the composite. Composition may be recursive. Synonym:
Composite aggregation.

==== Coordinate

One of a sequence of n numbers designating the position of a {{Point,point}}
in n-dimensional space.

NOTE: In a {{Coordinate Reference System,coordinate reference system}},
the coordinate numbers are qualified by units.

==== Coordinate Reference System

{{Coordinate}} system that is related to an object by a datum.

NOTE: For geodetic and vertical datums, the object will be the Earth.

==== Coordinate Tuple

Ordered list of {{Coordinate,coordinates}} where the number and order
of coordinates is identical to the axes of the
{{Coordinate Reference System,coordinate reference system}}.

==== Curve

1-dimensional {{Geometric Primitive,geometric primitive}}, representing
the continuous image of a line.

NOTE: The boundary of a curve is the set of points at either end of
the curve. If the curve is a cycle, the two ends are identical, and
the curve (if topologically closed) is considered to not have a boundary.
The first point is called the start point, and the last is the end
point. Connectivity of the curve is guaranteed by the "continuous
image of a line" clause. A topological theorem states that a continuous
image of a connected set is connected.

==== Curve Segment

1-dimensional geometric object used to represent a continuous component
of a {{Curve,curve}} using homogeneous interpolation and definition
methods.

NOTE: The geometric set represented by a single curve segment is equivalent
to a curve.

==== Data Product

A {{Dataset,dataset}} or dataset series that conforms to a data product
specification.

==== Data Quality

A set of elements describing aspects of quality, including a measure
of quality, an evaluation procedure, a quality result, and a scope.

==== Data Type

Specification of a value domain with operations allowed on values
in this domain.

NOTE: Data types include primitive predefined types and user-definable
types.

NOTE: A data type is identified by a term, for example Integer.

[example]
Integer, Real, Boolean, CharacterString, DirectPosition and S_100_TruncatedDate

==== Dataset

An identifiable collection of data.

NOTE: A dataset may be a smaller grouping of data which, though limited
by some constraint such as spatial extent or featuretype,is located
physically within a larger dataset. Theoretically, a dataset may be
as small as a single feature contained within a larger dataset.
A hardcopy map or chart may be considered a dataset.

==== Datum

Parameter or set of parameters that define the position of the origin,
the scale, and the orientation of a {{Coordinate,coordinate}} system.

==== Display Priority

Display priorities control the order in which the output of the portrayal
functions is processed by the rendering engine. Priorities with smaller
numerical values will be processed first. Instructions which have
equal display priority must be ordered so that area instructions are
rendered first, followed by line instructions, then point instructions,
and lastly text instructions. If the display priority is equal among
the same type of instruction (area, line, point, or text) some other
neutral criterion must be used to order the instructions.

==== ECDIS

A navigation information system which with adequate back-up arrangements
can be accepted as complying with the up-to-date chart required by
regulations V/19 and V/27 of the 1974 SOLAS Convention, as amended,
by displaying selected information from a System Electronic Navigational
Chart (System Database) with positional information from navigation
sensors to assist the Mariner in route planning and route monitoring,
and if required display additional navigation-related information.

==== ECDIS Chart 1

An ECDIS version of INT 1, including all symbols, line styles and
colour coding used for chart presentation. Intended for the Mariner
for both familiarization with ECDIS and to look up specific symbols.

==== Emergency Alarm

(MSC.302/A) highest priority of an {{Alert,alert}}. A condition presenting
an immediate danger to human life or to the ship and its machinery
exists and that immediate action must be taken.

==== ENC

The {{Dataset,dataset}}, standardized as to content, structure and
format, issued for use with {{ECDIS}} by or on the authority of a
Government authorized Hydrographic Office or other relevant government
institution, and conforming to IHO standards. The ENC contains all
the chart information necessary for safe navigation and may contain
supplementary information in addition to that contained in the paper
chart which may be considered necessary for safe navigation.

==== ENDS

A special-purpose database compiled from nautical chart and nautical
publication data, standardized as to content, structure and format,
issued for use with {{ECDIS}} by or on the authority of a Government,
authorized Hydrographic Office or other relevant government institution,
and conforming to IHO standards; and, which is designed to meet the
requirement of marine navigation and the nautical charts and nautical
publications carriage requirements in SOLAS regulations V/19 and V/27.
The navigational base layer of ENDS is the Electronic Navigational
Chart ({{ENC}}).

==== Enumeration

A fixed list of valid identifiers of named literal values.
{{Attribute,Attributes}} of an enumeration type may only take values
from this list.

==== Feature

Abstraction of real world phenomena.

NOTE: A feature may occur as a type or an instance. Feature type or
feature instance should be used when only one is meant.

[example]
The phenomenon named 'London Eye' may be classified as a feature instance
with other phenomena into a feature type 'landmark'

==== Feature Association

{{Relationship}} that links instances of one {{Feature,feature}} type
with instances of the same or a different {{Feature,feature}} type.

==== Feature Attribute

Characteristic of a {{Feature,feature}}.

NOTE: A feature attribute may occur as a type or an instance. Feature
attribute type or feature attribute instance is used when only one
is meant.

NOTE: A feature attribute type has a name, a data type and a domain
associated to it. A feature attribute instance has an attribute value
taken from the value domain of the feature attribute type.

NOTE: In a Feature Catalogue, a feature attribute may include a value
domain but does not specify attribute values for feature instances.

[example]
A feature attribute named _communication channel_ may have an attribute
value _VHF0007_ which belongs to the data type _text_

[example]
A feature attribute named _length_ may have an attribute value _82.4_
which belongs to the data type _real_

==== Feature Catalogue

A catalogue containing definitions and descriptions of the
{{Feature,feature}} types, {{Feature Attribute,feature attributes}},
and {{Feature Association,feature associations}} occurring in one
or more sets of geographic data.

==== Geometric Primitive

Geometric object representing a single, connected, homogeneous element
of geometry.

NOTE: Geometric primitives are non-decomposed objects that present
information about geometric configuration. They include points, curves,
surfaces, and solids.

==== Human Readable

A representation of information that can be naturally read by humans.

==== Identifier

A linguistically independent sequence of characters capable of uniquely
and permanently identifying that with which it is associated.

==== Indication

Visual indication giving information about the condition of a system
or equipment.

==== Instance

Entity to which a set of operations can be applied and which has a
state that stores the effects of the operations.

NOTE: See {{Feature,feature}}.

==== Machine Readable

A representation of information that can be processed by computers.

==== Maximum Display Scale

The value considered by the Data Producer to be the maximum (largest)
scale at which the data is to be displayed before it can be considered
to be "grossly overscaled".

==== Metadata

Data about data.

==== Minimum Display Scale

The minimum (smallest) scale with which the data is intended to be
displayed.

==== Model

Abstraction of some aspects of universe of discourse.

NOTE: A semantically complete abstraction of a system.

==== Multiplicity

Specification of the number of possible occurrences of a property,
or the number of allowable elements that may participate in a given
relationship.

[example]
1..* (one to many); 1 (exactly one); 0..1 (zero or one)

==== Optimum Display Scale

The maximum (largest) scale with which the data is intended to be
displayed.

NOTE: Optimum Display Scale may be considered to be the compilation
scale for the data, and is the reference for the overscale indication.
When the Mariners Selected Viewing Scale (MSVS) is set to a scale
that is larger than Optimum Display Scale, this triggers the overscale
indication in the end user system.

==== Overscale

The viewing scale is larger than the value considered by the Data
Producer to be the largest intended (optimum) display scale for the
data.

==== Point

0-dimensional {{Geometric Primitive,geometric primitive}}, representing
a position.

NOTE: The boundary of a point is the empty set.

==== Pointset

A set of {{Point,points}} in geometric space.

==== Portrayal Catalogue

Collection of defined portrayals for a
{{Feature Catalogue,feature catalogue}}.

NOTE: Content of a portrayal catalogue includes portrayal functions,
symbols, and portrayal context.

==== Record

Finite, named collection of related items (objects or values).

NOTE: Logically, a record is a set of pairs <name, item >.

==== Relationship

Semantic connection among model elements.

NOTE: Kinds of relationships include association, generalization,
metarelationship, flow, and several kinds grouped under dependency.

==== Scale Minimum

The smallest scale at which a feature is intended to be displayed
(for example, a minor light, with a scale minimum of 1:45,000, would
not normally be displayed at a scale of 1:90,000).

==== Skin of the Earth

A defined set of non-overlapping geographic features of geometric
primitive surface, completely covering an area equivalent to that
of meta-features *Data Coverage*.

==== Surface

Connected 2-dimensional {{Geometric Primitive,geometric primitive}},
representing the continuous image of a region of a plane.

NOTE: The boundary of a surface is the set of oriented, closed curves
that delineate the limits of the surface.

==== System Database

A database, in the manufacturer's internal ECDIS format, resulting
from the lossless transformation of the Electronic Navigational Data
Service (ENDS) contents and its updates. It is this database that
is accessed by ECDIS for the display generation and other navigational
functions, and is equivalent to up-to-date ENDS.

==== Temporal Reference System

Reference system against which time is measured.

==== Vertical Datum

Datum describing the relation of gravity-related heights or depths
to the Earth.

==== Viewing Scale

The value of the ratio of the linear dimensions of {{Feature,features}}
of a {{Dataset,dataset}} presented in the display and the actual dimensions
of the {{Feature,features}} represented of the {{Dataset,dataset}}.

==== Warning

(MSC.302/A) {{Alert,alert}} for condition requiring immediate attention,
but no immediate action by the bridge team. Warnings are presented
for precautionary reasons to make the bridge team aware of changed
conditions which are not immediately hazardous, but may become so
if no action is taken.

=== General S-101 data product description

NOTE: This information contains general information about the data
product.

*Title:*:: Electronic Navigational Chart

*Abstract:*:: An Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) is a vector chart
produced on the authority of a government authorized Hydrographic
Office or other relevant government institution. Its primary purpose
is for use within an Electronic Chart Display and Information System
(ECDIS) to meet International Maritime Organization (IMO) and Safety
of Life at Sea (SOLAS) chart carriage requirements; however it may
also be used as the base dataset in other S-100 based marine navigation
systems. The ENC contains an extraction of real world information
necessary for the safe navigation of vessels.

*Content:*:: The Product Specification defines all requirements to
which ENC data products must conform. Specifically it defines the
data product content in terms of features and attributes within the
Feature Catalogue. The display of features is defined by the symbols
and rule sets contained in the Portrayal Catalogue. The Data Classification
and Encoding Guide (DCEG) provides guidance on how data product content
must be captured. (<<annexA>>.)

*Spatial Extent:*::
+
--
*Description:* Areas specific to marine navigation.

*East Bounding Longitude:* 180°

*West Bounding Longitude:* -180°

*North Bounding Latitude:* 90°

*South Bounding Latitude:* -90°
--

*Purpose:*:: The purpose of an ENC dataset is to provide official
navigational data for navigation systems for the safe passage and
route planning of vessels between destinations.

[[sec_1.6]]
=== IHO Product Specification maintenance

[[sec_1.6.1]]
==== Introduction

Changes to S-101 will be released by the IHO as a New Edition, revision,
or clarification.

[[sec_1.6.2]]
==== New Edition

_New Editions_ of S-101 introduce significant changes. _New Editions_
enable new concepts, such as the ability to support new functions
or applications, or the introduction of new constructs or data types.
_New Editions_ are likely to have a significant impact on either existing
users or future users of S-101. All cumulative _revisions_ and _clarifications_
must be included with the release of approved New Editions.

[[sec_1.6.3]]
==== Revision

_Revisions_ are defined as substantive semantic changes to S-101.
Typically, _revisions_ will change S-101 to correct factual errors;
or introduce necessary changes that have become evident as a result
of practical experience or changing circumstances. A _revision_ must
not be classified as a clarification. _Revisions_ could have an impact
on either existing users or future users of S-101. All cumulative
_clarifications_ must be included with the release of approved revisions.

Changes in a _revision_ are minor and ensure backward compatibility
with the previous versions within the same Edition. Newer revisions,
for example, introduce new features and attributes. Within the same
Edition, a dataset of one version could always be processed with a
later version of the Feature and Portrayal Catalogues.

In most cases a new Feature Catalogue or Portrayal Catalogue will
result in a _revision_ of S-101.

[[sec_1.6.4]]
==== Clarification

_Clarifications_ are defined as non-substantive changes to S-101.
Typically, _clarifications_: remove ambiguity; correct grammatical
and spelling errors; amend or update cross references; and insert
improved graphics. A _clarification_ must not cause any substantive
semantic change to S-101.

Changes in a _clarification_ are minor and ensure backward compatibility
with the previous versions.

[[sec_1.6.5]]
==== Version numbers

The associated version control numbering to identify changes (n)
to S-101 must be as follows:

New Editions denoted as *n*.0.0

Revisions denoted as n.*n*.0

Clarifications denoted as n.n.*n*
