== Dataset Identification

A dataset that conforms to this Product Specification may be identified
by its discovery metadata as defined in <<sec_12>>.

*Title:*:: Electronic Navigational Chart

*Alternate Title:*:: ENC

*Abstract:*:: ENCs must be produced in accordance with the rules defined
in the S-101 Product Specification. The S-101 Product Specification
contains all the information necessary to enable Hydrographic Offices
to produce a consistent ENC; and manufacturers to use that data within
navigation systems.

*Topic Category:*:: Transportation
(ISO 19115-1 MD_TopicCategoryCode 018)

*Geographic Description:*:: Areas specific to marine navigation

*Spatial Resolution:*:: An ENC dataset and *Data Coverage* features
must carry a value for optimum display scale. Each *Data Coverage*
feature must also carry a value for maximum and minimum display scale.
Values for optimum and minimum display scales must be taken from the
following Table:
