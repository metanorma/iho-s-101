== Metadata

[[sec_12.1]]
=== Introduction

For information exchange, there are several categories of metadata
required: metadata about the overall Exchange Catalogue; metadata
about each of the datasets contained in the Catalogue; and metadata
about the support files that make up the package.

S-100 Part 17, Figures 17-1, 17-6 and 17-7 outline the overall concept
of an S-100 Exchange Set for the interchange of geospatial data and
its relevant metadata. Figure 17-1 depicts the realization of the
ISO 19115-1 and 19115-3 classes which form the foundation of the Exchange
Set. The overall structure of S-101 metadata for Exchange Sets is
the same as S-100 metadata. Figure 17-6 depicts the structure of the
Exchange Set Catalogue and the structure of the Exchange Set as included
in S-100 part 17, Figure 17-1 is also described in <<sec_11.2>> above.
More detailed information about the various classes is shown in
Figure 17-7 and a textual description in the Tables is included at
clauses <<sec_12.1.1;to!sec_12.1.4>> below.

The discovery metadata classes have numerous attributes which expose
important information about the ENCs, ENC support files and system
support files to be examined without the need to process the data,
for example decrypt, decompress, load etc.

System support files, such as Feature and Portrayal Catalogues or
codelist dictionary files, can be included in the Exchange Set in
support of the end-user system. The attribute "resourcePurpose" of
the ENC Support File Discovery Metadata provides a mechanism to "read"
and apply these system support files more easily.

The following clauses define the mandatory and optional metadata needed
for S-101. In some cases the metadata may be repeated in a national
language. If this is the case it is noted in the Remarks column.

In the following clauses, wherever S-101 makes an optional S-100 metadata
attribute mandatory (that is, restricts multiplicity from 0.. to 1..),
the restricted multiplicity is shown in place of the multiplicity
given in S-100 Part 17, and a comment noting the restricted multiplicity
has been included in the Remarks column.

==== S100_ExchangeCatalogue

The Exchange Catalogue inherits the Dataset Discovery Metadata, Support
File Discovery Metadata and Catalogue Discovery Metadata from S-100
Part 17 with additional S-101-specific restrictions.

time values of records in all features are used, which means the earliest
and latest values may be from different features

If date/time information for a feature is not encoded in the dataset,
it is treated for the purposes of this attribute as extending indefinitely
in the appropriate direction on the time axis, limited by the issue
date/time or the cancellation or supersession of the dataset

This attribute is encoded if and only if at least one of the start
and end of the temporal extent is known

[[note_1]]
NOTE: description: During the ENC Dual-Fuel transition period, it is recommended that the attribute description is used to identify equivalent S-57 ENCs in S-101. This information is to be semicolon separated to distinguish it from any other information, for example for 1 to 1 mapping <XC:description>;GB5DNABH;</XC:description> and for more than one equivalent S-57 ENC: <XC:description>;NL4NZ110;NL5WS130;</XC:description>. If the mapping is partial, a "p" should be included at the end of the S-57 dataset name, for example <XC:description>;GB5DNABHp;</XC:description>. There may be scenarios for non-ECDIS use only, where S-101 ENCs are produced without equivalent S-57 ENCs; this should be shown using an "n" as <XC:description>;n;</XC:description>

[[note_2]]
NOTE: replacedData and dataReplacement: The attribute replacedData is mandatory if the attribute purpose (see <<sec_12.1.2.3>>) is set to value _5_ (cancellation). The attribute dataReplacement is mandatory if replacedData = _True_.

* prohibit maintenanceScope, maintenanceNote, and contact attributes;
* define restrictions on maintenanceAndUpdateFrequency, maintenanceDate,
and userDefinedMaintenanceFrequency attributes

| Attribute | maintenanceAndUpdateFrequency | Frequency with which changes and additions are made to the resource after the initial resource is completed | 0..1 | MD_MaintenanceFrequencyCode (codelist) | Must be populated if userDefinedMaintenanceFrequency is not present, otherwise optional. See Table MD_MaintenanceFrequencyCode in this Part for values allowed in S-100 metadata
| Attribute | maintenanceDate | Date information associated with maintenance of the resource | 0..1 | CI_Date | Exactly one of maintenanceDate and userDefinedMaintenanceFrequency must be populatedAllowed value for dateType: nextUpdate
| Attribute | userDefinedMaintenanceFrequency | Maintenance period other than those defined | 0..1 | TM_PeriodDuration | Exactly one of maintenanceDate and userDefinedMaintenanceFrequency must be populatedOnly positive durations allowed

=== Language

The exchange language must be English. Other languages may be used
as a supplementary option. National geographic names can be left in
their original national language using the complex attribute
