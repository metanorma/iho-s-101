== Introduction

S-101 is the Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) Product Specification,
produced by the International Hydrographic Organization. S-101 is
designed to allow content, content definition (Feature Catalogues)
and presentation (Portrayal Catalogues) to be updateable as
"Plug and Play" system implementations.

Based on the IHO Universal Hydrographic Data Model S-100, S-101 includes
all the necessary components for both Hydrographic Offices to produce
Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs); and marine navigation systems
(principally Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS))
to be able to ingest and properly display them. This Product Specification
is designed to be flexible with the introduction of machine-readable
Feature and Portrayal Catalogues that will allow for managed change;
and will enable the introduction of new navigationally significant
features and their portrayal using a "just in time" methodology.
