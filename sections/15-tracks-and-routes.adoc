== Geo Features -- Tracks and Routes

[[sec_15.1]]
=== Leading, clearing and transit lines and recommended tracks (see S-4 -- B-433 and B-434)

If it is required to encode leading, clearing and transit lines and recommended tracks, it must be done using the features *Navigation Line* and *Recommended Track*(see clauses 15.4 and 15.5), and related point navigational aids features (see Section 20). This applies for visual and radio navigational aids.

NB. In North America the word "range" is used instead of "transit" and "leading line".

[[sec_15.1.1]]
==== Range systems - relationship

To encode a range system, the features **Navigation Line**, *Recommended Track* and the navigational aids features should be associated with the feature *Range System* (see clause15.6) using the association *Range System Aggregation* (see clause 25.13).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* All features comprising a range system must have the same value populated for the attribute *scale minimum* (see clause2.5.9).

[[sec_15.2]]
=== Traffic Lanes

A traffic lane is an area within defined limits in which one way traffic is established. Natural obstacles, including those forming separation zones may constitute a boundary (IMO Ships' Routeing). These lanes of travel may be composed of the following features: *Traffic Separation Scheme Lane Part* and *Deep Water Route Part*.

[[sec_15.3]]
=== Traffic separation schemes and traffic separation scheme systems (see S-4 -- B-435.1-3)

A traffic separation scheme is a routeing measure aimed at the separation of opposing streams of traffic by appropriate means and by the establishment of traffic lanes (IMO Ships' Routeing). A traffic separation scheme separates opposing streams of marine traffic by the establishment of separation zones or lines and traffic lanes. It may include inshore traffic zones or Deep Water routes. A separation zone or line separates:

. The traffic lanes in which ships are proceeding in opposite or nearly opposite directions;
. A traffic lane from the adjacent sea area; or
. Traffic lanes designated for particular classes of ships proceeding in the same direction.

If it is required to encode a traffic separation scheme, it must be done using:

- Deep Water routes (DW -- a route within defined limits which has been accurately surveyed for clearance of sea bottom and submerged obstacles as indicated on the chart (IMO Ships' Routeing)). Deep Water routes are encoded using **Deep Water Route Centreline**; *Deep Water Route Part* and *Deep Water Route* features (see clauses15.13to 15.15);

- *Inshore Traffic Zone* (see clause 15.16);

- *Precautionary Area*(see clause 15.17);

- **Separation Zone or Line**, **Traffic Separation Scheme Boundary**, **Traffic Separation Scheme Crossing**, **Traffic Separation Scheme Lane Part**, *Traffic Separation Scheme Roundabout* and *Traffic Separation Scheme* (see clauses 15.18to15.23); and

- Navigational aids features (see Sections 18 to 21).

For guidance on provision of advance notification of changes to traffic separation schemes, see clause 31.1.1.

To encode a traffic separation scheme (TSS) system, the **Deep Water Route Centreline**, **Deep Water Route Part**, **Inshore Traffic Zone**, **Precautionary Area**, **Separation Zone or Line**, **Traffic Separation Scheme Boundary**, **Traffic Separation Scheme Crossing**, **Traffic Separation Scheme Lane Part**, *Traffic Separation Scheme Roundabout* features must be associated with the *Traffic Separation Scheme* (see clause15.23) using the association *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* (see clause 25.18). The *Traffic Separation Scheme* may additionally be associated to the aids to navigation marking the components of the Scheme (if they are stated in the regulation defining the TSS or Deep Water route) using the association *Aids to Navigation Association* (see clause 25.2). Where it is required to indicate the name of the complete TSS, this must be done using the attribute feature name for the *Traffic Separation Scheme*. Where it is required to populate textual information for the TSS, this should be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) for the *Traffic Separation Scheme*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Traffic separation scheme systems may be included with other routeing measures such as Deep Water or two-way routes, or another traffic separation scheme system, to comprise a complete traffic routeing system. To encode the relationship between routeing measures, the named association defining each routeing measure within the system (or the relevant feature if the routeing measure consists of a single feature) may be associated using a *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* to form a hierarchical relationship (see clause25.18). The individual elements comprising different routeing measures must not be aggregated into a single named association.
* All features comprising a TSS, TSS system or deep water route must have the same value populated for the attribute *scale minimum* (see clause 2.5.9).

==== Navigation lines (see S-4 -- B-433)

Clearing Linesare important in rocky areas where dangers are not guarded by buoys and where sailing vessels (which are not always able to keep to a direct track) and other small craft may navigate close inshore. Transits marking isolated dangers are based on beacons or other marks which are erected on shore to indicate (approximately, unless there are two pairs of beacons) the position of an isolated danger. Leading lines based on beacons or lights must be encoded where the optimum display scale for the ENC data permits. Leading lines based on natural features should be encoded on the largest optimum display scale ENC data where they appear to be useful, particularly if other navigational aids seem inadequate.If it is required to encode a navigation line, it must be done using the feature *Navigation Line*.The use of *Navigation Line* and *Recommended Track* (see clause 15.5) is defined in more detail in the following Table, and in Figure 15-4 below:

Remarks:

* The value populated for the mandatory attribute *orientation value* must be the value of the bearing from seaward.
* The extent of the navigation line depends on the visibility of the navigational aids.
* The recommended track is that portion of a navigation line that a ship should use for navigation.

[[sec_15.4.2]]
==== Measured distances (see S-4 -- B-458)

If the track to be followed is on a leading line or a bearing, it must be encoded in the way described in the Table and Figure 15-4 above (cases 1 or 4). If the track is not on a leading line or bearing, it must be encoded only as a *Navigation Line* feature with the attribute *category of navigation line* being set to an empty (null) value. In either case, if it is required to encode the measured distance, it must be done using the attribute *measured distance*.If it is required to encode the transit lines, they must be done using *Navigation Line* features, with *category of navigation line* = _2_ (transit line).If it is required to encode the beacons, they must be done using *Special Purpose/General Beacon* features, with attribute *category of special purpose mark* = _17_ (measured distance mark).On occasions, one or more of the transits used for the measured distance may incorporate an existing landmark as the front or rear mark. In this case, if *Landmark* is encoded, *category of special purpose mark* = _17_ must also be populated.Where the entire measured distance system exists within a single dataset, each transit line with its beacons must be associated with the feature *Range System* (see clause15.6) using the association *Range System Aggregation* (see clause 25.13). These two associations and the track to be followed must be associated with another instance of *Range System* to form a hierarchical relationship.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* All features comprising a measured distance must have the same value populated for the attribute *scale minimum* (see clause2.5.9).

==== Recommended tracks (see S-4 -- B-432.1; B-434 and B-434.1-4)

Recommended tracks and fairways usually comprise a number of sections (sometimes termed "legs") which lead between dangers lying close on both sides of the track or fairway. Tracks commonly include some sections which are leading lines (see clause15.1). The distinction between tracks and fairways, in this context, is that tracks have no specified outer limits and fairways do have specified outer limits.It is important to recognise that it is not the role of cartographers to create "recommended" tracks and other "recommended" routeing measures; such recommendations are made by other authorities. The word "Recommended", used in connection with recommended tracks and other recommended routeing measures usually implies that it has been recommended by a competent authority (such as a port authority within its port limits or a maritime safety authority) and may be adopted by IMO. Occasionally, the recommendation may be based on advice directly from a competent surveyor or established by precedent.Recommended tracks include all channels recommended for hydrographic reasons to lead safely between shoal depths. The use of such tracks is generally left to the discretion of the Mariner and will depend on the vessel's draught, the state of the tide, adequacy of navigational aids and so on.If it is required to encode a recommended track, it must be done using the feature *Recommended Track*.The use of *Navigation Line* and *Recommended Track* is defined in more detail in the following Table, and in Figure 15-5 below.

Remarks:

* The attribute *depth range minimum value* is used to encode the shallowest depth along the track, where required.
* The attribute *maximum permitted draught* is used to encode the maximum draught permitted on the track, where required.
* The recommended track is that portion of a navigation line (see clause15.4) that a ship should use for navigation (see Figure 15-5 above).
* In the case of a two-way recommended track, only one value of orientation is encoded (in the mandatory attribute *orientation value*); the other value can be deduced (that is, the value in *orientation value* + 180 degrees). The value of orientation encoded on *orientation value* should be the value of the bearing from seaward. If it is not possible to define a seaward direction, the value that is less than 180° should be used.
* When the traffic flow along a recommended track is one way (attribute *traffic flow* = __1__, _2_ or _3_), the resultant direction of the line (accounting for the direction of digitising and any subsequent reversal of the line) associated with the *Recommended Track* must be the same as the direction of the traffic flow, in order to ensure the correct representation in the ECDIS of the direction to be followed.

==== Range systems (see S4 -- B-433)

If it is required to encode leading, clearing and transit lines and recommended tracks, it must be done using the features *Navigation Line* and *Recommended Track* (see clauses15.4and 15.5), and related point navigational aids features (see Sections 18-21). This applies for visual and radio navigational aids.To encode a range system, the features **Navigation Line**, **Recommended Route Centreline**, *Recommended Track* and the navigational aids features should be associated with the feature *Range System* using the association *Range System Aggregation* (see clause 25.13).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The name of the range system may be populated using the complex attribute *feature name*. Where it is required for the name to be displayed in the ECDIS, the *Range System* must be encoded using curve or surface geometry. The extent of the geometry of the *Range System* should utilise the geometry of the components of the system so as to cover its full extent.
* All features comprising a range system must have the same value populated for the attribute *scale minimum* (see clause 2.5.9).
* Multiple *Range System* features may be further aggregated hierarchically using the association *Range System Aggregation* to define a higher level range system.

A fairway, sometimes called Ship Channel, is the main navigable channel in the approaches to, or within, a river or harbour. Fairways which are designated by a regulatory authority are treated as Routeing Measures.If it is required to encode a fairway, it must be done using the feature *Fairway*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The attribute *depth range minimum value* is used to encode the shallowest depth in the fairway, where known.
* The attribute *maximum permitted draught* is permitted on *Fairway* only where the *Fairway* defines the entire system (that is, the *Fairway* has not been associated with other *Fairway* features and the feature *Fairway System* (see clause 15.8) to define a complete fairway system).

* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.
* Where beacons or buoys marking a fairway are offset from the actual fairway limits, this should be indicated using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).
* To encode a complete fairway system, the *Fairway* features may be associated with the feature *Fairway System* using the association *Fairway Aggregation* (see clause 25.7). The navigational aids features defining a fairway section may be associated with the *Fairway* using the association *Fairway Auxiliary* (see clause 25.8). Where it is required to indicate the name of a complete fairway system, this should be done using the complex attribute *feature name* for the *Fairway System* feature; or on a single *Fairway* feature where this feature defines the entire system. Where it is required to encode textual information for the fairway system, this should be done using the complex attribute *information*.

A fairway, sometimes called Ship Channel, is the main navigable channel in the approaches to, or within, a river or harbour. Fairways which are designated by a regulatory authority are treated as Routeing Measures.A fairway system is composed of two or more *Fairway* features that comprise a complex fairway routeing system, for instance a long fairway comprising several bends. To define the complete fairway system, the *Fairway* features must be aggregated in a *Fairway System* feature, using the association *Fairway Aggregation* (see clause 25.7).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The name of the complete fairway system must be populated using the complex attribute *feature name*. Where it is required for the name to be displayed in the ECDIS, the *Fairway System* must be encoded using surface geometry. The extent of the geometry of the *Fairway System* should utilise the geometry of the components of the system so as to cover its full extent.
* All features comprising a fairway system must have the same value populated for the attribute *scale minimum* (see clause2.5.9).
* Where it is required to populate textual information for the fairway system, this should be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6), or if the information is considered essential for safe navigation, using a *Caution Area* feature (see clause16.10).

==== Recommended routes (see S-4 -- B-435.4)

A recommended route is a route of undefined width, for the convenience of ships in transit, which is often marked by centreline buoys. (IMO Ships Routeing, 2010). IMO-designated recommended routes are listed in IMO publication "__Ships' Routeing__"Part E. This type of routeing measure was adopted to include such features as the "transit routes" (through former minefields) in the entrances to the Baltic Sea. In contrast to recommended tracks (see clause15.5), there is usually ample sea-room for vessels to keep well starboard (to the right) of the centreline.If it is required to encode the centreline of a recommended route, it must be done using the feature *Recommended Route Centreline*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The attribute *depth range minimum value* is used to encode the shallowest depth on the route, where known.
* In the case of a recommended route centreline, only one value of orientation is encoded (in the attribute *orientation value*); the other value can be deduced (that is, the value in *orientation value* + 180 degrees). The value of orientation encoded on *orientation value* should be the value of the bearing from seaward. If it is not possible to define a seaward direction, the value that is less than 180° should be used.
* When the traffic flow is one way (attribute *traffic flow* = __1__, _2_ or _3_), the resultant direction of the line (accounting for the direction of digitising and any subsequent reversal of the line) associated with the *Recommended Route Centreline* must be the same as the direction of traffic flow, in order to ensure the correct representation in the ECDIS of the direction to be followed.

==== Two-way Routes (see S-4 -- B-435.6)

A two way route is a route within defined limits inside which two way traffic is established, aimed at providing safe passage of ships through waters where navigation is difficult or dangerous (IMO Ships Routeing, 2010). It consists of one or more areas within which traffic flows in two directions along one bearing and/or its reciprocal. Such routes are established by regulatory authorities and may be adopted by IMO. IMO-designated two-way routes are listed in IMO publication "__Ships' Routeing__"Part E. When it is required to encode these areas, this must be done using the feature *Two-Way Route Part*. These route parts will generally be two-way, but some may be restricted to one-way traffic flow.

__**Figure 15-6 -- One-way traffic flow in a two-way route**__
image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_bc034dbe.gif[Shape33,359,213]

If it is required to encode a two-way route with one-way sections, separate *Two-Way Route Part* features must be encoded for the different parts, with attribute *traffic flow* = _3_ (one-way) or _4_ (two-way). In one-way sections, the mandatory attribute *orientation value* must indicate the true direction of traffic flow, not its reciprocal. In two-way sections, *orientation value* may indicate either direction of traffic flow. Remarks:

* The orientation of the two-way route part is defined by the centreline of the part and is related to the general direction of the two-way route.
* The attribute *depth range minimum value* is used to encode the shallowest depth on the part, where required.
* To encode a complete Two-way route, the *Two-Way Route Part* features must be associated with the feature *Two-Way Route* (see clause15.11) using the association *Two-Way Route Aggregation* (see clause 25.19). Where it is required to indicate the name of a complete two-way route, this should be done using the complex attribute *feature name* for the *Two-Way Route* feature. Where it is required to encode textual information for the complete two-way route, this should be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) for the *Two-Way Route* feature.
* All *Two-Way Route Part* features comprising a complete two-way route must have the same value populated for the attribute *scale minimum* (see clause 2.5.9).
* Two-way routes may be included with other routeing measures such as traffic separation schemes to comprise a complete traffic routeing system. To encode the relationship between routeing measures, the feature defining each routeing measure within the system (or the relevant feature if the routeing measure consists of a single feature) may be associated with the feature *Traffic Separation Scheme* (see clause 15.23) using the *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* (see clause25.18) to form a hierarchical relationship. The individual elements comprising different routeing measures must not be collected into a single *Traffic Separation Scheme* feature.

==== Recommended traffic lane part (see S-4 -- B-435.5)

Recommended direction of traffic flow is a traffic flow pattern indicating a recommended directional movement of traffic where it is impractical or unnecessary to adopt an established direction of traffic flow. (IMO Ships Routeing, 2010). IMO-designated recommended directions of traffic flow are listed in IMO publication "__Ships' Routeing__"Part E. Several hydrographic offices, in consultation with their Ministries of Transport, have added recommended directions in areas such as the outer approaches to major ports in order to show the best routes for crossing traffic or to minimise the risk of head-on encounters.The feature *Recommended Traffic Lane Part* must be used, where required, to encode areas with a recommended direction of traffic flow which is generally along one bearing:

* between two traffic separation schemes (TSS) (INT1 -- M 26.1);
* in the entrance area of a TSS; or
* along the outside of a Deep Water route (INT1 -- M 26.2).
[underline]#Remarks:#

* When the area is not defined, a point feature should be encoded.
* The orientation of the recommended traffic lane part is defined by the centreline of the part and is related to the general direction of traffic flow in the recommended traffic lane.

==== Deep Water route centrelines (see S-4 -- B-435.3)

A complete Deep Water route (DW) consists of one or more areas within which the flow of traffic either follows one defined direction for one-way traffic, or follows one defined direction and its reciprocal for two-way traffic.If it is required to encode the centreline of a Deep Water route, the width of which is not explicitly defined, it must be done using the feature *Deep Water Route Centreline*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* In the case of a deep water route centreline, only one value of orientation is encoded (in the mandatory attribute *orientation value*); the other value can be deduced (that is, the value in *orientation value* + 180 degrees). The value of orientation encoded on *orientation value* should be the value of the bearing from seaward. If it is not possible to define a seaward direction, the value that is less than 180° should be used.
* When the traffic flow is one way (attribute *traffic flow* = __1__, _2_ or _3_), the resultant direction of the line (accounting for the direction of digitising and any subsequent reversal of the line) associated with the *Deep Water Route Centreline* must be the same as the direction of traffic flow, in order to ensure the correct representation in the ECDIS of the direction to be followed.
* The complex attribute *feature name*should only be used if the individual feature is not included in an association (see clause15.15.1).
* To encode a complete Deep Water route, the **Deep Water Route Centreline**,*Deep Water Route Part* features, and the navigational aids features (if they are stated in the regulation defining the DW), may be associated with the feature *Deep Water Route* (see clause15.15) using the associations *Deep Water Route Aggregation* (see clause 25.6) and *Aids to Navigation Association* (see clause25.2). Where it is required to indicate the name of a complete DW, this should be done using the complex attribute *feature name* for the *Deep Water Route* feature; or on a single *Deep Water Route Centreline* feature where this feature defines the entire DW. Where it is required to encode textual information for the DW, this should be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) for the *Deep Water Route* feature; or on a single *Deep Water Route Centreline* feature where this feature defines the entire DW.
* Deep Water routes, unlike dredged areas, are likely to be designated in offshore waters outside the immediate supervision of harbour authorities (although some do form the outer approaches to deep water ports). No least depth quoted can be fully guaranteed in most cases. Least depths within the route should be encoded by soundings as elsewhere on the ENC dataset so that the navigator will not assume that the depths are continually monitored. However, in those cases where a hydrographic authority feels confident to guarantee the existence of a minimum depth of water in a DW route, it must be populated using the attribute *depth range minimum value*.
* Deep water routes may be included with other routeing measures such as traffic separation schemes to comprise a complete traffic routeing system. To encode the relationship between routeing measures, the feature defining each routeing measure within the system (or the relevant feature if the routeing measure consists of a single feature) may be associated with the feature *Traffic Separation Scheme* (see clause 15.23) using the *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* (see clause 25.18) to form a hierarchical relationship. The individual elements comprising different routeing measures must not be collected into a single *Traffic Separation Scheme* feature.
* IMO-designated Deep Water routes are listed in IMO publication "__Ships' Routeing__"Part C. Where *Deep Water Route Centreline* features are included in the associations *Deep Water Route Aggregation* or **Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation**, the attribute *IMO adopted* must not be populated for the *Deep Water Route Centreline* features.

==== Deep Water route parts (see S-4 -- B-435; B-435.3 and B-436.3)

A complete Deep Water route (DW) consists of one or more areas within which the flow of traffic either follows one defined direction for one-way traffic, or follows one defined direction and its reciprocal for two-way traffic.If it is required to encode these areas, this must be done using the feature *Deep Water Route Part*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.
* The complex attribute *feature name*should only be used if the individual feature is not included in an association (see clause 15.15.1).
* The route must be covered by *Depth Area* or *Dredged Area*features.
* A Deep Water route part may overlap a *Traffic Separation Scheme Lane Part* feature.
* To encode a complete Deep Water route, the **Deep Water Route Centreline**,*Deep Water Route Part* features, and the navigational aids features (if they are stated in the regulation defining the DW), may be associated with the feature *Deep Water Route* (see clause 15.15) using the associations *Deep Water Route Aggregation* (see clause 25.6) and *Aids to Navigation Association* (see clause25.2). Where it is required to indicate the name of a complete DW, this should be done using the complex attribute *feature name* for the *Deep Water Route* feature; or on a single *Deep Water Route Part* feature where this feature defines the entire DW. Where it is required to encode textual information for the DW, this should be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) for the *Deep Water Route* feature; or on a single *Deep Water Route Part* feature where this feature defines the entire DW.
* Deep Water routes, unlike dredged areas, are likely to be designated in offshore waters outside the immediate supervision of harbour authorities (although some do form the outer approaches to deep water ports). No least depth quoted can be fully guaranteed in most cases. Least depths within the route should be encoded by soundings as elsewhere on the ENC dataset so that the navigator will not assume that the depths are continually monitored. However, in those cases where a hydrographic authority feels confident to guarantee the existence of a minimum depth of water in a DW route, it must be populated using the attribute *depth range minimum value*.
* The orientation of the Deep Water route part is defined by the centreline of the part and is related to the general direction of traffic flow in the Deep Water route.
* Deep water routes may be included with other routeing measures such as traffic separation schemes to comprise a complete traffic routeing system. To encode the relationship between routeing measures, the feature defining each routeing measure within the system (or the relevant feature if the routeing measure consists of a single feature) may be associated with the feature *Traffic Separation Scheme* (see clause 15.23) using the *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* (see clause 25.18) to form a hierarchical relationship. The individual elements comprising different routeing measures must not be collected into a single *Traffic Separation Scheme* feature.
* IMO-designated Deep Water routes are listed in IMO publication "__Ships' Routeing__"Part C. Where *Deep Water Route Part* features are included in the associations *Deep Water Route Aggregation* or **Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation**, the attribute *IMO adopted* must not be populated for the *Deep Water Route Part* features.

==== Traffic separation scheme lanes (see S-4 -- B-435.1)

A traffic lane is an area within defined limits in which one-way traffic flow is established. Natural obstacles, including those forming separation zones, may constitute a boundary. (IHO Dictionary -- S-32). A complete traffic separation scheme lane consists of one or more areas within which the flow of traffic follows one defined direction. If it is required to encode these areas, this must be done using the feature *Traffic Separation Scheme Lane Part*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* At junctions, other than crossings and roundabouts, a separate *Traffic Separation Scheme Lane Part* feature must be encoded. For this feature, the attribute *orientation value* must be omitted, in order to avoid implying that one lane has priority over another (see INT1 -- M22). Warning text may be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6). In some cases, a precautionary area is established where routes meet or cross (see clause 15.17.1).

_*Figure 15-7 -- Junction*_
image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_fded47e2.gif[Shape34,308,147]


* The orientation of the traffic separation scheme lane part is defined by the centreline of the part and is related to the general direction of traffic flow in the traffic separation lane.
* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.

If it is required to encode a traffic separation scheme (TSS), it must be done using:- Deep Water routes (DW -- a route within defined limits which has been accurately surveyed for clearance of sea bottom and submerged obstacles as indicated on the chart. (IMO Ships Routeing, 2010)). Deep Water routes are encoded using **Deep Water Route Centreline**, *Deep Water Route Part* and *Deep Water Route* features (see clauses15.13 to 15.15);- *Inshore Traffic Zone* (see clause15.16);- *Precautionary Area*(see clause 15.17);- **Separation Zone or Line**, **Traffic Separation Scheme Boundary**, **Traffic Separation Scheme Crossing**, **Traffic Separation Scheme Lane Part**, *Traffic Separation Scheme Roundabout* (see clauses 15.18to 15.22); and- Navigational aids features (see Sections18 to 21).To define the complete traffic separation scheme system, these features must be associated with the feature *Traffic Separation Scheme* using the association *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* (see clause25.18); and any associated aids to navigation should be associated with the *Traffic Separation Scheme* using the association *Aids to Navigation Association* (see clause 25.2).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The name of the TSS must be populated using the complex attribute *feature name*. Where it is required for the name to be displayed in the ECDIS, the *Traffic Separation Scheme* must be encoded using surface geometry. The extent of the geometry of the *Traffic Separation Scheme* should utilise the geometry of the components of the scheme so as to cover its full extent.
* Where it is required to encode an IMO declared Area to be Avoided within a TSS, this must be done using the feature *Restricted Area* (see clause 17.8), with attribute *restriction* = _14_ (area to be avoided).
* Where it is required to populate textual information for the TSS, this should be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) for the **Traffic Separation Scheme**; or if the information is considered essential for safe navigation, using a *Caution Area* feature (see clause16.10).
* All features comprising a traffic separation scheme must have the same value populated for the attribute *scale minimum* (see clause2.5.9).
* Multiple *Traffic Separation Scheme* features may be further aggregated hierarchically using the association *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* to define a higher TSS.

[underline]#Distinction:# Deep Water Route; Fairway System; Two-Way Route.

==== Archipelagic Sea Lane area (see S-4 -- B-435.10)

Article 53 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) states that: "an archipelagic State may designate sea lanes ..., suitable for the continuous and expeditious passage of foreign ships ... through ... its archipelagic waters and the adjacent Territorial Sea. ... All ships ... enjoy the right of archipelagic sea lanes passage in such sea lanes ... [which] include all normal passage routes used as routes for international navigation … through archipelagic waters". (Note: references to aircraft and air routes in UNCLOS have been omitted in these extracts from Article 53). (IHO S-4 B-435.10, C-51 Appendix 2 Part II).Any archipelagic State which wishes to designate Archipelagic Sea Lanes (ASL) must propose them to IMO for adoption as ASL including all normal passage routes and navigational channels as required by UNCLOS. ASL are adopted by IMO in accordance with the relevant provisions of UNCLOS.If it is required to encode an Archipelagic Sea Lane, it must be done using *Archipelagic Sea Lane Area* and/or *Archipelagic Sea Lane Axis* (see clause15.25) features, and possibly navigational aids features.The unique character of Archipelagic Sea Lanes (ASLs) is specified by UNCLOS Article 53 and Part H, General Provision of IMO Ships Routeing. Further information is provided in the IHO publication C-51 (Manual on Technical Aspects of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea).The encoding of relationships between these features is defined in clause 15.27.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The feature *Archipelagic Sea Lane Area* encodes the area of an Archipelagic Sea Lane.
* In some cases only accurate information on the axes (**Archipelagic Sea Lane Axis**, see clause15.25) may be available and in such cases the extents of the ASL (*Archipelagic Sea Lane Area*) may not be able to be encoded.
* To encode an Archipelagic Sea Lane (ASL) system, the **Archipelagic Sea Lane Area****,** *Archipelagic Sea Lane Axis* features, and any navigational aids features (if they are stated in the regulation defining the ASL), may be associated with the feature *Archipelagic Sea Lane* (see clause15.26) using the associations *ASL Aggregation* (see clause25.3) and *Aids to Navigation Association* (see clause25.2). Where the association *ASL Aggregation* has been created, it is not required to populate the attribute *nationality* on *Archipelagic Sea Lane Area*. Where it is required to indicate the name of a complete ASL system, this should be done using the complex attribute *feature name* for the *Archipelagic Sea Lane* feature. Where it is required to encode textual information for the ASL, this should be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).
* Traffic within an ASL is not separated, except in any traffic separation schemes which may be designated in an ASL for the safe passage of ships.

==== Radio calling-in (reporting) points (see S-4 -- B-488.1 and B-488.2)

Radio reporting points, also called radio calling-in points, have been established in certain busy waterways and port approaches to assist traffic control. On passing these points or crossing a defined line vessels are required to report on VHF to a Traffic Control Centre.If it is required to encode a radio reporting point or line, it must be done using the feature *Radio Calling-In Point*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Each *Radio Calling-In Point*feature of type point must carry at least one orientation, using the attribute *orientation value*. If it is required to encode the reciprocal orientation, to indicate that a bearing and its opposite apply to a *Radio Calling-In Point* feature, it must be done using attribute *traffic flow* = _4_ (two-way). If the same position is used for another orientation (not opposite) of traffic flow, a second *orientation value* attribute must be encoded.
* The complex attribute **feature name**, sub-attribute *name*is used to encode the name and/or alphanumeric designator of the *Radio Calling-In Point*.
* The complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) is used to provide additional information, where required. For example, if the requirement to report by radio relates to certain classes of vessels only.
* *Radio Calling-In Point* features of type curve must be encoded such that resultant direction of the line (accounting for the direction of digitising and any subsequent reversal of the curve) is related such that the direction of traffic that is required to report is to the right. For curve features, it is not required to populate *orientation value*.

==== Ferries (see S-4 -- B-438)

Ferry routes should be encoded on the largest optimum display scale ENC datasets:

** where they cross fairly narrow channels, in order that through traffic is warned of their existence;
** where the ferry tracks are short enough to be reasonably accurately represented; and
** on ENCs used for harbour navigation, as part of the general information about the area.
If it is required to encode a ferry route, it must be done using the feature *Ferry Route*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Long distance ferrieswhich have routes varying with weather, tide and traffic should not generally be encoded, although the terminals should be shown on appropriate optimum display scale ENC datasets, using the feature *Harbour Facility* (see clause22.7), with attribute *category of harbour facility* = _1_ (RoRo-terminal) or _3_ (ferry terminal).

==== Radar reference lines (see S-4 -- B-487.2)

Radar reference linesare mid-channel lines corresponding to lines incorporated in Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) radar displays. A line is used as a positional reference so that the VTS authorities may easily provide a vessel with its position, relative to the line, when visibility is poor. These must be charted on appropriate optimum display scale ENC data.If it is required to encode a radar reference line, it must be done using the feature *Radar Line*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The value of orientation encoded on the mandatory attribute *orientation value* should be the value of the bearing from seaward. If it is not possible to define a seaward direction, the value that is less than 180° should be used.
* If it is required to encode the area of a VTS containing radar lines, this should be done using the feature *Vessel Traffic Service Area* (see clause 22.2).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Coast radar stations are shore-based stations which the Mariner can contact by radio to obtain a position. These stations are being increasingly replaced by other position-fixing methods.
* The *Radar Station* must only be used to encode the technical equipment itself, independent of the building or structure in which it is installed. If it is required to encode the building or structure (for example mast, tower, radar dome) it must be done using an appropriate feature (for example**Building**, *Landmark*). There is no requirement to establish a Structure/Equipment association between the *Radar Station* feature and the structure in which it is installed.
* The attribute *height* is used to encode the height of the emitting part of the radar, where known.
* Each VHF-channel should be indicated, using the attribute *communication channel* (see clause27.77). Alternately, if the same VHF-channel(s) apply to multiple features in the dataset, this should be indicated through an associated instance of the information type **Contact Details**, attribute *communication channel* (see clause 24.1).
