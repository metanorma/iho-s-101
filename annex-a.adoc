== Overview

[[sec_1.1]]
=== Preface

The "Data Classification and Encoding Guide" has been developed to provide consistent, standardized instructions for encoding S-100 compliant ENC data. This document has been laid out, as far as possible, along the lines of the IHO publication S-4, Part B "Chart Specifications of the IHO – Medium and Large-Scale National and International (INT) Charts".

The purpose of the Data Classification and Encoding Guide is to facilitate S-101 encoding to meet IHO standards for the proper display of ENC in an ECDIS. The document describes how to encode information that the cartographer considers relevant to an ENC. The content of an ENC is at the discretion of the producing authority provided that the conventions described within this document are followed. A "producing authority" is a Hydrographic Office (HO) or an organization authorized by a government, HO or other relevant government institution to produce ENCs.

The entire S-100 Standard, including the S-101 ENC Product Specification, is available at the following web site,https://iho.int/.

== General

The S-101 Data Classification and Encoding Guide describes how data describing the real world should be captured using the types defined in the S-101 Feature Catalogue (see S-101 Product Specification Main document clause 4.3). It provides the encoding rules and guidance required to create S-101 ENCs. This standard is specifically concerned with those entities in the real world that are of relevance to hydrography. This hydrographic regime is considered to be geo-spatial. As a result, the model defines real-world entities as a combination of descriptive and spatial characteristics. Within the model these sets of characteristics are defined in terms of feature, spatial and information types. A type is defined as a stereotype of class that is used to specify a domain of instances (features) together with the operations applicable to the features. A type may have attributes and may be related to other types.

The types used within S-101 are described below. Within this document feature types, information types, associations and attributes appear in *bold* text.

[[sec_2.1]]
=== Feature types

Feature types contain descriptive attributes and do not contain any geometry (that is, information about the shape and position of a real-world entity).

Features have two aspects – feature type and feature instance. A feature type is a class and is defined in a Feature Catalogue. A feature instance is a single occurrence of the feature type and represented as an object in a dataset. A feature instance is located by a relationship to one or more spatial instances. A feature instance may exist without referencing a spatial instance.

S-101 makes use of the following feature types:

*Geographic (Geo) feature type* – carries the descriptive characteristics of a real-world entity.

*Cartographic feature type* – contains information about the cartographic representation (including text) of real-world entities.

*Meta feature type* – contains information about other features. Information defined by Meta features override the default metadata values defined by the dataset descriptive records. Meta attribution on individual geographic feature instances overrides attribution on Meta features.

[[sec_2.1.1]]
==== Multiple features

On some sources, multiple features in close proximity are generalised to a single feature with a text string indicating the presence of the other features. In such cases, where it is considered that this information may be useful for visual navigation, one feature of the appropriate class should be encoded and the true number of features, if known, must be encoded using the complex attribute **multiplicity of features**, sub-attribute **number of features**, with Boolean sub-attribute *multiplicity known* set to _True_ (see clause 27.131). If the true number of features is not known, *multiplicity of features* Boolean sub-attribute *multiplicity known* must be populated as _False_. If *multiplicity of features* is not an allowable attribute for the feature, multiplicity may be indicated using the complex attribute **information**, sub-attribute *text* (for example _3 trees_. If the true number of features is not known, the text "__more than one__" should be encoded using *information* (*text*).

Multiple submerged features in close proximity, which have been generalised to a single feature, should not have the multiplicity indicated unless the multiplicity has some significance to safe navigation. This is so as to minimise the presence of ECDIS "information" symbols, which may contribute to screen clutter (see clause2.4.6).

For the encoding of multiple, identical lights using the complex attribute **multiplicity of features**, see Table 19-2 in clause 19.1.7.

For the encoding of leading lights that are required to be merged due to scale, see clause 19.1.5.

There is no method within ENC to indicate to the Mariner that a feature has not been encoded in its true position, therefore it is considered important for features to be encoded in their true position to provide the Mariner with an accurate representation of the real world.

Encoders are advised, therefore, that if it is required to encode a feature which has been displaced on the source, it should be captured in its real-world position on the ENC.

[[sec_2.2]]
=== Information types

An information type is an identifiable object that can be associated with features in order to carry information particular to the associated features. An example of the use of an information type may be the requirement to include a note about overhead cables. Information types can also be associated with other information types. This may be done where there is further supplementary information that is relevant to the information type.

Information types carry attributes but not geometry.

[[sec_2.3]]
=== Geometric primitives

The allowable geometric primitive for each feature type is defined in the Feature Catalogue. Within this document, allowable primitives are included in the tables containing a description of each feature type. Allowable geometric primitives are point, pointset, curve and surface.

Each spatial value must be referenced by at least one feature instance.

Within this document, allowable primitives are included in the description of each feature type. For easy reference, Table 2-1 below summarises the allowable geometric primitives for each feature type. For some features, the allowable geometric primitives may be further constrained dependant on the populated values of attributes for a feature instance. Where this occurs, these constraints are described in the feature Table entries in Sections 3-24.

In the Table, abbreviations are as follows: point (P), pointset (A), curve (C) and surface (S). A feature that may have no geometric primitive is annotated as none (N).

[[sec_2.3.1]]
==== Capture density guideline

It is recommended that curves and surface boundaries should not be encoded at a point density greater than 0.3mm at the optimum display scale for the ENC data.

A curve consists of one or more curve segments. Each curve segment is defined as a loxodromic line on WGS84. Long lines may need to have additional coordinates inserted to cater for the effects of projection change.

The presentation of line styles may be affected by curve length. Therefore, the encoder must be aware that splitting a curve into numerous small curves may result in poor symbolization.

[[sec_2.4]]
=== Attributes

Attributes may be simple type or complex type, and are described in Sections 27-30. Complex (C) attributes (Section 29) are aggregates of other attributes that can be simple type (Sections 27 and 28) or complex type. Simple attributes in S-101 are assigned to one of 9 types (see clause2.4.2).

The binding of attributes to feature types, the binding of attributes to attributes to construct complex attributes and attribute multiplicity is defined in the Feature Catalogue. Within this document, the allowable attributes are included in the description of each feature type, as well as attribute multiplicity and the allowable values for enumeration type attributes. Where relevant, constraints for other attribute types such as value range for integer and real type attributes; and string format and maximum string length for text type attributes as defined in the Feature Catalogue are also described.

[[sec_2.4.1]]
==== Multiplicity

In order to control the number of allowed attribute values or sub-attribute instances within a complex, S-100 uses the concept of multiplicity. This defines lower and upper limits for the number of values, whether the order of the instances has meaning and if an attribute is mandatory or not. Common examples are shown in Table 2-2 below:

Format : __MinOccurs__, _MaxOccurs_ (if \* Infinite) _(ordered)_ – sequential

[NOTE,keep-separate=true]
====
The function of the S-57 attribute type "List" has been replaced by Enumeration (EN) with an upper limit of multiplicity greater than 1. This means that when more than one value is needed for an enumeration type attribute, the attribute code is populated multiple times with the required values.
====

[example]
A red and white tower is encoded with attribute *colour* = _3_ (red) and *colour* = _1_ (white). Within this document, this example would be indicated as "*colour* = __3,1__".

[[sec_2.4.2]]
==== Simple attribute types

Each simple attribute in S-101 is assigned to one of 9types:

EN:: Enumeration: A fixed list of valid identifiers of named literal values. Attributes of an enumeration type may only take values from this list. The complete list of allowable values for S-101 enumeration type attributes is included in Sections 27, 28 and 30; these values may be further constrained for the binding of the attribute to specific feature and information types.

BO:: Boolean: A value representing binary logic. The value can be either (1) __True__, (2) _False_ or empty (Unknown). The "default state" for Boolean type attributes, unless stated otherwise in this document, is _False_ for instances where the attribute is allowable for a feature, is non-mandatory and has not been populated (and is therefore not included for the feature instance). An empty (Unknown) value should only be populated where the Boolean type attribute is mandatory but the value (_True_ or _False_) is not known to the encoder.

RE:: Real: A signed Real (floating point) number consisting of a mantissa and an exponent. The representation of a real is encapsulation and usage dependent.
+
--
In S-100, "precision", as it applies to the IHO GI Registry and the S-101 Feature Catalogue, is defined as a non-negative integer expressing the constraint of the exponent of a real number (that is, "1" means the real number is constrained to a precision of 0.1; "2" means the real number is constrained to a precision of 0.01; etc) (S-100 Part 2a, clause 2a-4.2.10). For the attribute descriptions included in Sections 27, 28 and 30 of this document, the values quoted for precision are expressed in more "human-readable" terms as the exponent of the real type attribute (0.1, 0.01, 0.001, …).

Examples: 23.501, -0.0001234, -23.0, 3.141296
--

IN:: Integer: A signed integer number. The representation of an integer is encapsulation and usage dependent.
+
--
Examples: 29, -65547
--

TE:: Text: A CharacterString, that is an arbitrary-length sequence of characters including accents and special characters from a repertoire of one of the adopted character sets.

TD:: Truncated Date (S100­_TruncatedDate): Allows a partial date to be encoded as an extension to the ISO 8601 compliant date attribute type values for year, month and day according to the Gregorian Calendar. Character encoding of a date is a string which follows the calendar date format (complete representation, basic format) for date specified by ISO 8601. See clause2.4.8.
+
--
Example: 19610922 (YYYYMMDD)
--

TI:: Time: A time is given by an hour, minute and second in the 24-hour clock system. Character encoding of a time shall be a complete representation of the basic format as defined in ISO 8601. Complete representation means that hours, minutes and seconds shall be used. Basic format means that separating characters are omitted.
+
--
Time is preferably expressed as Universal Time Coordinated (UTC).

Example:183059Z

Time may be expressed as a Local Time with a given offset to UTC.

Example:183059+0100

Time may be expressed as a Local Time without a specified offset to UTC.

Example:183059

The complete representation of the time of 27 minutes and 46 seconds past 15 hours locally in Geneva (in winter one hour ahead of UTC), and in New York (in winter five hours behind UTC), together with the indication of the difference between the time scale of local time and UTC, are used below as examples.

Geneva__:__ 152746+0100

New York: 152746-0500

The service hours for a service, that is available all year in an area where Daylight Saving Hour affects the offset to UTC, could be expressed as Local Time without specified offset.

Example: Opening: 074500 Closing: 161500
--

URI:: Universal Resource Identifier: A derivation of CharacterString. URI is a uniform resource identifier as defined in RFC 3986. Character encoding of a URI must follow the syntax rules defined in RFC 3986.
+
--
For S-101, the attribute type URI is constrained to conformance with the HTTP or HTTPS protocols; that is, the character string must commence with _http://_ or _https://_.

Example: https://registry.iho.int
--

URN:: Universal Resource Name: A derivation of the CharacterString predefined derived type Universal Resource Identifier (URI). URN allows a persistent, location-independent, resource identifier to be encoded that follows the syntax and semantics for URNs specified in RFC 2141.
+
--
For S-101, the attribute type URN is used mainly to define Maritime Resource Names (MRN), typically in the IHO namespace – _urn:mrn:iho:…_ .

Example: urn:mrn:iho:s101:2:0:0:AnchorageArea
--

Real or integer attribute values must not be padded by non-significant zeroes. For example, for a signal period of 2.5 seconds, the value populated for the attribute *signal period* must be 2.5 and not 02.50.

NOTE: For real values between -1.0 and 1.0, the mantissa component zero is considered to be significant. For example, *0*.01; -*0*.999.

[[sec_2.4.3]]
==== Mandatory and conditional attributes

Some attributes are mandatory and must be populated for a given feature type. The following are reasons why attribute values may be considered mandatory:

* They are required to support correct portrayal by determining
** whether a feature is in the display base
** which symbol is to be displayed;

* Certain features make no logical sense without specific attributes; and
* Some attributes are required for safety of navigation.

In Table 2-3 below, mandatory attributes for which this is relevant for a feature (that is, the attribute should not be populated with an empty (null) value) are indicated by the superscript \*.

Within this document, mandatory attributes (multiplicity 1,1; 1,n (n>1); or 1,*) are identified in the description of each feature type. For easy reference, Table 2-3 summarises the mandatory attributes for each feature type (note that mandatory sub-attributes of complex attributes are not included in this Table – see NOTE 2 below Table 2-3):

[NOTE]
====
Sub-attributes of complex attributes, as well as the complex attribute itself, may also be designated as mandatory (see NOTE 2 below). "Conditional" mandatory attributes are identified in the feature Tables in Sections 3-24 by the superscript ^†^, with qualifying comments included after the attribute list for the relevant feature; and are also indicated in Table 2-3 above by the following additional text:

_over navigable water*_:: for **Bridge**, **Cable Overhead**, **Conveyor**, *Pipeline Overhead*

_at least one of_:: for **Caution Area**, **Information Area**, **Land Region**, **Marine Farm/Culture**, **Sea Area/Named Water Area**, **Nautical Information**, **Non-Standard Working Day**, **Spatial Quality**, *Chart 1 Feature*

_if navigable at…._:: for *Gate*

_except when….._:: for **Archipelagic Sea Lane Area**, **Archipelagic Sea Lane Axis**, *Traffic Separation Scheme Lane Part*

_(point features only)_:: for *Radio Calling-In Point*

_one of_:: for **Cable Overhead**, **Obstruction**, *Wreck*

\* __over navigable water__, in the context of ENC encoding, is defined as areas covered by Skin of the Earth features **Depth Area**, **Dredged Area**, or *Unsurveyed Area*.

Compilers must consider these conditional circumstances when encoding features for ENC, as well as any additional information given in the feature class descriptions in this document. For example, when encoding a **Cation Area**, the mandatory attributes are _at least one of_*information* or *pictorial representation* – if the relevant information is textual, *information* must be populated and there is no requirement to populate **pictorial representation**, which therefore should not be populated with an empty (null) value, as it is not mandatory in this case.
====

NOTE: For complex attributes, at least one sub-attribute is mandatory (or conditionally mandatory) however mandatory sub-attributes of complex attributes have not been included in Table 2-3 above. Where the sub-attribute of a complex is conditionally mandatory (for example, for the feature *Seabed Area*_at least one of_ the sub-attributes *nature of surface* or *nature of surface – qualifying terms* must be populated for the complex attribute *surface characteristics*), this is indicated by the superscript ^†^ as for the "Conditional" mandatory attributes described in Note 1 above.

NOTE: The attribute *colour pattern* is mandatory for any feature (except lights features) that has more than one value populated for the attribute *colour*.

NOTE: The ECDIS "system" attribute *default clearance depth* must be populated with a value, which must not be an empty (null) value, if the attribute *value of sounding* is populated with an empty (null) value (see clause 30.1).

[[sec_2.4.4]]
==== Missing attribute values

Where a value of a mandatory attribute is not known, the attribute must be populated with an empty (null) value (however, see first paragraph of clause 2.4.3 above).

Where the value of a non-mandatory attribute is not known, the attribute should not be included in the dataset.

In a base dataset, when an attribute code is present but the attribute value is missing, it means that the Producer wishes to indicate that this attribute value is unknown.

In an Update dataset, when an attribute code is present but the attribute value is missing it means:

* that the value of this attribute is to be replaced by an empty (null) value if it was present in the original dataset, or

* that an empty (null) value is to be inserted if the attribute was not present in the original dataset.

[[sec_2.4.5]]
==== Portrayal feature attributes

The primary use of ENC is within ECDIS where ENC data is displayed based on the rules defined within the S-101 Portrayal Catalogue. While most ECDIS portrayal is based on attributes describing the instance of a particular feature in the real world, certain feature attributes are used in portrayal rules to provide additional functionality in the ECDIS or information to the Mariner. The following attributes have specific influence on portrayal:

*drawing index* -- population of this attribute may assist with the identification of a set of S-101 datasets that are intended to form a seamless presentation, regardless of scale; and identify a hierarchy of such seamless presentations (see clause 3.5 and S-101 Main document clauses 4.6 and 4.7).

**fixed date range**; *periodic date range* -- population of these complex attributes determines when the feature will be added (sub-attribute *date start*) and/or removed (sub-attribute *date end*) from the display in some ECDIS display settings (see clause 2.4.8).

*information* -- population of this complex attribute will result in the display of the magenta information symbol to highlight additional information to the user.

*name usage* -- this sub-attribute determines the priority and level of display (full display or Pick Report only) where multiple instances of the complex attribute *feature name* are encoded for a single feature instance, based on Mariner's selected ECDIS display settings (see clause 2.5.8).

*pictorial representation* -- population of this attribute will result in the display of the magenta information symbol to highlight additional information to the user.

*scale minimum* -- value at which the feature will be removed from the display if application of scale minimum is enabled in the ECDIS (see clause2.5.9).

*sector line length* -- population of this attribute will result in the sector lines and arc radius of the sector being extended by the defined length when the ECDIS display is set to display default light sectors. See clause 19.3.1.

*visual prominence* -- this attribute determines that visually conspicuous features are shown in black colour rather than brown.

[[sec_2.4.5.1]]
===== ECDIS "system" (portrayal) attributes

Attributes designated as "ECDIS system" attributes are intended to provide information specific to aiding in portrayal of features in ECDIS in certain circumstances; and should be automatically populated by the ENC production software as required. The population of these attributes are conditional dependant on individual encoding instances including the relationship between an encoded feature and the underlying Skin of the Earth feature(s); and resolution of conflicts in portrayal specific to collocated light features. These attributes are described in Section 30 of this document, and include:

*default clearance depth* (see clause 30.1) – this attribute is intended to provide a depth value to the ECDIS to aid in the display of underwater hazards (**Obstruction**, **Underwater/Awash Rock**, *Wreck*) where the actual depth of the underwater hazard is unknown (attribute *value of sounding* populated with an empty (null) value). This value is algorithmically calculated by the production system as required, based on the underlying depth(s) as described in clause 30.1. For S-101 ENCs, *default clearance depth* must be populated with a value, which must not be an empty (null) value, if the attribute *value of sounding* is populated with an empty (null) value.

*in the water* (see clause 30.2) – this Boolean attribute provides an indication to the ECDIS that features that are located in or over navigable water are to be included in the ECDIS Base Display. This attribute is automatically populated by the ENC production software where a structure is located over an area of bathymetry (**Depth Area**, **Dredged Area**, *Unsurveyed Area*).

*sector arc extension* (see clause 30.3) – this Boolean attribute provides an indication that a distance beyond the default distance at which a light sector arc will be displayed is required where more than one sector light having overlapping sectors has been encoded. This attribute is automatically calculated and populated as required by the ENC production software. Note that *sector arc extension* is not utilised where light sectors are displayed at the nominal range of the sectors.

*surrounding depth* (see clause 30.4) – this attribute defines a depth value for the area surrounding an underwater hazard to aid in the portrayal of isolated dangers in ECDIS, and is based on the *depth range minimum value* for the surrounding *Depth Area*(s). This attribute is automatically calculated and populated as required by the ENC production software. For an area feature covered by more than one **Depth Area**, the value of *surrounding depth* is determined as the depth range minimum value of the deeper of the *Depth**Area* features covering the underwater hazard. For S-101 ENCs, *surrounding depth* must be populated with a value, which must not be an empty (null) value.

[[sec_2.4.6]]
==== Textual information

The complex attribute*information* (see clause 29.9) contains information as text using the sub-attribute **text**, or the name of an ENC support file using the sub-attribute **file reference**, in English and, optionally, using multiple instances of *information* to encode the information in one or more additional languages; and where bound to the geo feature classes may be used to encode additional textual information specific to a single feature instance. General conventions for the population of *information* for a feature instance are as follows:

* Where required, only a single mandatory instance of *information* in English (mandatory sub-attribute *language* = _eng_ or empty (null)) must be encoded.
* Further optional instances of *information* may also be encoded (sub-attribute *language* populated with the three-letter language code in conformance with ISO 639-2/T) in one or more languages.

The information type *Nautical Information* (see clause24.4) should be used to encode additional textual information associated to a group of features; and if the information is specific to a single feature, the information should be encoded on the feature itself. The *Nautical Information* is associated to the relevant features using the association *Additional Information* (see clause 25.1).

The complex attribute *information* must not be used when it is possible to encode the information by means of any other attribute. Under certain ECDIS display settings the "information" symbol will display when this attribute is populated. Therefore Producers should carefully consider use of this attribute as the symbol may contribute significantly to ECDIS screen clutter.

Character strings contained in *information* sub-attribute *text* must be UTF-8 character encoding. *Information* should generally be used for short notes or to transfer information which cannot be encoded by other attributes, or to give more detailed information about a feature. Text populated in *text* must not exceed 300 characters.

The exchange language for textual information should be English. Languages other than English may be used as a supplementary option, for which *language* must be populated with an appropriate value to indicate the language. Generally this means, when a national language is used in the textual attributes, the English translation must also exist.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For Guidance on encoding names of features, see clause 2.5.8.

[[sec_2.4.7]]
==== Spatial attribute types

Spatial attribute types must contain referenced geometry and may be associated with spatial quality attributes. Each spatial attribute instance must be referenced by a feature instance or another spatial attribute instance.

[[figure_2-1]]
.Spatial Quality information type
image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_757f3cda.jpg["",505,514]

Spatial quality attributes are carried in the information type *Spatial Quality* (see clause24.5). Only point, multipoint and curve geometry and the Meta feature *Quality of Bathymetric Data*can be associated with *Spatial Quality*. Currently no use case for associating surfaces with spatial quality attributes is known, therefore this is prohibited; however it is allowable for *Spatial Quality* to be associated with the curves comprising the spatial edges (boundaries) of surface features. Vertical uncertainty is prohibited for curves as this dimension is not supported by curves.

[[sec_2.4.8]]
==== Dates

When encoding dates using the attributes **dredged date**, **fixed date range**, **reported date**, **reference year for magnetic variation**, *survey date range* and **swept date**, the following values must apply in conformance to S-100.

* Full date: YYYYMMDD
* No specific day required: YYYYMM--
* No specific month required: YYYY----

If it is required to encode periodic/recurring dates using the attributes *date fixed* and **periodic date range**, the following values must apply in conformance to S-100.

* No specific year required, same day each year: ----MMDD
* No specific year required, same month each year: ----MM--

Notes: YYYY = calendar year; MM = month; DD = day.

The dashes (-) indicating that the year, month or day is not needed must be included.

Encoded date ranges are inclusive, see S-100 Part 3, clause 3-8.3. For example:

*fixed date range*/*date start* = _20220922_ Commences at 000000 hours on 22 September 2022

*fixed date range*/*date end* = _20221022_ Ends at 240000 hours on 22 October 2022.

*periodic date range*/*period start* = _----09--_ Commences annually at 000000 hours on 01 September.

*periodic date range*/*date end* = _----09--_ Ends annually at 240000 hours on 30 September.

Where the temporal attributes have been encoded for any feature that is the structure component of a *Structure/Equipment* feature association (see clause 25.16), all other component features within the relationship must not extend beyond the temporal attribute values encoded for the structure feature.

[[sec_2.4.8.1]]
===== Seasonal features

If it is required to show seasonality of features, it must be done using the attribute *status* = _5_ (periodic/intermittent). If it is required to encode the start and/or end dates of the season, this must be done using the complex attribute *periodic date range* (see clauses 2.4.8 and 29.15).

Where there is a requirement to indicate the beginning or end date of a seasonal occurrence as the "last day in February", consideration must be given to allowing for the extra day (29^th^ February) added on leap years. Encoding **periodic date range**, sub-attribute *date end* with the value ----_0228_ may result in erroneous indication of seasonality in the ECDIS on the 29^th^ February for leap years, while encoding the value ----_0229_ may similarly result in ECDIS performance issues for non-leap years. Encoders are advised, therefore, that where it is required to encode the end of seasonality as the last day in February, this must be done, similar to any other month of the year, by encoding the value of **periodic date range**, sub-attribute *date end* as --_--02­­--_. Where the beginning of seasonality is the last day in February, this must be done by encoding the value of **periodic date range**, sub-attribute *date start* in accordance with the next occurrence of the date (--_--0228_ if the next occurrence is a non-leap year or --_--0229_ if the next occurrence is a leap year). The ENC dataset must be amended by ENC Update (see Section 31) where the date is required to be changed. For instance, if the value is --_--0228_ and the next occurrence is a leap year, an ENC Update must be created to amend the date to --_--0229_.

Alternatively, if encoders consider that there is no regulatory requirement to update the start date of a period for leap years, the value of *date start* may be populated as&nbsp;--__--03--__, indicating a beginning date of 01 March each year.

[[sec_2.4.9]]
==== Times

If it is required to show the beginning and end of the active time period of a feature, it must be encoded using the attributes *time of day end* (see clause27.182)and *time of day start* (see clause27.183). The attribute descriptions for *time of day end* and *time of day start* state that the format must conform to ISO 8601, and this format must be used (see also clause 2.4.2).

Time is preferably expressed as Universal Time Coordinated (UTC). Where required, this must be done using the format __hhmmssZ__, with 2 digits for the hour (_hh_), 2 digits for the minutes (_mm_) and 2 digits for the seconds (_ss_); and "__Z__" mandatory.

EXAMPLE: _183059Z_ to represent a UTC time of 30 minutes and 59 seconds after 6 o'clock in the evening

If it is required to express Local Time with a given offset to UTC, this must be done using the format _hhmmss+hhmm_.

EXAMPLE: _183059+0100_ to represent a local time that is 1 hour ahead of UTC

In areas that are subject to daylight saving hours during certain periods of the year, it may be more appropriate to provide local times that are independent of a UTC offset. If it is required to express Local Time without a specified offset to UTC, this must be done using the format _hhmmss_.

EXAMPLE: _183059_ to represent a local time of 30 minutes and 59 seconds after 6 o'clock in the evening

[[sec_2.4.9.1]]
===== Schedules

If it is required to indicate the time schedule associated with any feature, it must be encoded using the information types *Service Hours* (see clause24.2) or*Non-Standard Working Day* (see clause24.3). *Service**Hours* is used to indicate the regular operational schedule and/or times of closure for a service related to a feature. *Non-Standard Working Day* is used to indicate specific days of the year when normal working hours are limited, and may not be related to the Gregorian calendar.

====
A feature service is available under normal operation status 24 hours/day on Monday and Wednesday and from 08:00 to 16:00 (local time – note the format for local time without specified offset to UTC in clause 2.4.9 above) from Thursday to Saturday. The service is not available on public holidays and the 05 of August of each year.

[[sec_2.4.10]]
==== Colours and colour patterns

If it is required to encode multiple colours on a feature, they must be encoded using the attributes *colour pattern* and *colour* as follows:

* For horizontal stripes (*colour pattern* = _1_), the values for *colour* must be ordered such that the first colour is the top-most, and subsequent colours follow sequentially from top to bottom. For example, *colour* = _3,1_ to encode a red stripe above a white stripe.
* For vertical stripes (*colour pattern* = _2_), the values for *colour* must be ordered such that the first colour is the left-most, and subsequent colours follow sequentially from left to right. For example, *colour* = _3,1,3_ to encode red, white, red vertical stripes

* For diagonal stripes (*colour pattern* = _3_), the values for *colour* must be ordered such that the first colour is the top-left-most, and subsequent colours follow sequentially from top left to bottom right. Forexample,*colour* = _1,3,1,3,1_ to encode white, red, white, red, white diagonal stripes.

* For squares (*colour pattern* = _4_), the values for *colour* must be ordered such that the first colour is the top-left-most square. Subsequent colours follow sequentially from left to right along the top row then repeated for subsequent rows until the bottom right-most square is reached. For example, *colour* = _1,3,3,1_ to encode white, red squares on the top row and red, white squares on the bottom row.

* For border stripes (*colour pattern* = _6_), the values for *colour* must be ordered such that the first colour is the border stripe, and the second colour that of the background. For example, *colour* = _3,1_ to encode a red border stripe on a white background. Where a border stripe is combined with other patterns, an assessment as to which pattern is most important to marine navigation must be made, and the appropriate value populated in *colour pattern*.

Note that the attribute *colour pattern* is mandatory for any feature (except lights) that has more than one colour.

If the encoded colours and colour pattern for feature is considered to be complex, it is strongly recommended that an image of the feature, if available, is also included using the attribute *pictorial representation*.

[[sec_2.4.11]]
==== Radar conspicuous features (see S-4 – B-485.2)

The Boolean attribute *radar conspicuous* is used to encode whether or not a feature is radar conspicuous.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode a feature which has no radar reflector, but is radar conspicuous, it must be indicated using attribute *radar conspicuous* = _True_.
* If it is required to encode a surface or point feature which is radar conspicuous because it is fitted with a radar reflector, it must be indicated using attribute *radar conspicuous* = _True_ on the feature where *radar conspicuous* is an allowable attribute. Where *radar conspicuous* is not an allowable attribute for the feature, a *Radar Reflector* feature (see clause20.17) must be encoded within or coincident with the feature.
* If it is required to encode radar reflectors on curve features (for example overhead cables), this must be done using the feature *Radar Reflector*.

[[sec_2.4.12]]
==== Attributes referencing ENC support files

The complex attribute *information* and its sub-attribute *file reference* on the information type *Nautical Information* (see clause 24.4) or on individual geo features references textual ENC support files. The simple attribute *pictorial representation* on *Nautical Information* or on individual geo features references picture files. The association *Additional Information* (see clause 25.1) is used to create an association between the geo feature(s) and *Nautical Information* where required. Where the information is relevant to a single feature instance only, it should be encoded using *information* or *pictorial representation* on the feature instance. Where the information is relevant to multiple feature instances, it should be encoded using *information* or *pictorial representation* on an associated instance of *Nautical Information*. See also clause 2.4.6.

The attributes *information* and *pictorial representation* are considered portrayal feature attributes (see clause 2.4.5), meaning that under given circumstances the "information" symbol (magenta "i") will be portrayed in ECDIS when one or both of these attributes are populated. Due to risk of ECDIS screen clutter, Producers should carefully consider the use of these attributes.

These attributes must not be used when it is possible to encode the information by means of any other attribute.

Clause 11.2 of the S-101 Product Specification Main document specifies the content of an Exchange Set and the inclusion of support files. Clause 11.4 of the Product Specification Main document outlines specific rules and limitations for support files and their management; and additionally details ENC support file creation and application use cases.

[[sec_2.4.12.1]]
===== Reference to textual ENC support files

The ENC support files referenced by the complex attribute **information**, sub-attribute **file reference**, must be.TXT files, and may contain formatted text. These files should generally be used for longer texts (for example longer chart notes, tables or paragraphs from Nautical Publications), but should not be used to replicate large blocks of text (for example entire chapters of Sailing Directions) that can be found in other Nautical Publications, which may not be suitable for viewing in ECDIS. It is up to the Producing Authority to determine the most suitable means of encoding a particular piece of text. Textual ENC support files must be encoded using the character set defined in ISO 10646-1, in Unicode Transformation Format-8 (UTF-8).

The exchange language for textual information should be English. The sub-attribute *language* must be populated with an appropriate value to indicate the language used. Languages other than English may be used as a supplementary option. Generally this means, when a national language is used in the textual attributes, the English translation must also exist.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Encoders must encode national language ENC support files (files referenced by the sub-attribute *file reference*) using UTF-8 character encoding. This means that the encoding of the characters in these files must match the encoding of other textual national attributes (that is,**feature name**, *information* (*text*) with value other than English populated for sub-attribute *language*) within the dataset.

[[sec_2.4.12.2]]
===== Reference to pictorial ENC support files

The attribute *pictorial representation* should only be populated where the information is considered important in terms of safety of navigation and protection of the marine environment. Pictorial ENC support files that form part of the ENC must be in Tagged Image File (TIF) format 6.0.

Encoders should also consider, when including a reference to a pictorial ENC support file, whether the file is appropriate in terms of:

* Size of the file: Pictorial files should be kept to a minimum file size, and should be considered in relation to the maximum allowable size of an ENC dataset (10Mb). Therefore, for example, a pictorial file of 100Mb should be considered to be inappropriate. Using the following values as a guideline for TIF files will ensure acceptable size pictorial ENC support files:

[[table_2-4]]
.Recommended formatting for TIF files used as ENC support files
[cols="215,209"]
|===
h| Recommended Resolution: h| 96 DPI
| Minimum Size x,y:         | 200,200 pixels
| Maximum Size x,y:         | 800,800 pixels
| Bit Depth:                | 8 Bit Indexed Colour
| Compression:              | LZW
| Format:                   | Tiff 6.0
|===

* Content of the graphic: The information contained in the pictorial file should supplement, in terms of navigational relevance, the encoding of the associated feature. For example, an image of a standard IALA special purpose buoy that duplicates the attribution of the associated *Special Purpose/General Buoy* provides no relevant supplementary information to the Mariner (and may be considered to be double encoding), and therefore should not be included.

* Aspect: Graphics should provide perspective relevant to the view of the Mariner. For example, an image of the top of a bridge derived from a photograph taken from the top of a bridge tower or nearby building does not provide the Mariner with any information relevant to their location, and should not be included. However, an image derived from a photograph taken from a vessel approaching the bridge may be considered relevant.

* Suitability for display in ECDIS: Graphics should be such that all the information in the pictorial file is legible in the ECDIS display. For example, text included in diagrams or tables must be large enough so as to be legible when the file is opened in the ECDIS display. Images included in a pictorial file should also be appropriately scaled such that they comfortably fit in the picture display window on the ECDIS (that is, do not only take up a very small area of the window; or are so large that the image needs to be panned to see the entire image). Consideration must also be given to variation in ships' bridge lighting conditions. It is recommended that, where possible, ENC support files are tested by opening the file in an ECDIS prior to publication of the ENC.

[[sec_2.5]]
=== Datasets

A Dataset is a grouping of features, attributes, geometry and metadata which comprises a specific coverage.

Four types of ENC dataset may be produced and contained within an exchange set:

* Update: Changing some information in an existing dataset.
* Re-issue of a dataset: Including all the Updates applied to the original dataset up to the date of the reissue. A Re-issue does not contain any new information additional to that previously issued by Updates.
* New dataset and New Edition of a dataset: Including new information which has not been previously distributed by Updates. Each New Edition of a dataset must have the same name as the dataset that it replaces.

See also S-101 Main document, Section 4.5 in addition to the sub-clauses below for further information regarding ENC datasets.

[[sec_2.5.1]]
==== ENC data coverage

An ENC dataset can contain more than one *Data Coverage* (see clause3.5). The data boundary is defined by the extent of the *Data Coverage* Meta features. Data must only be present within *Data Coverage* Meta features.

Producing Authorities must not leave "holes" (that is, areas not covered with data) in smaller scale range coverage, under the assumption that the ECDIS user will have the larger scale data available. For areas covered by larger scale ENCs, well established cartographic data generalization practices should be applied, including the inclusion of minimum depiction areas (see clause 2.5.3.2 below).

An ENC Update dataset must not change the extent of the data coverage for the base ENC cell. Where the extent of the data coverage for a base ENC cell is to be changed, this must be done by issuing a New Edition of the cell.

[[sec_2.5.1.1]]
===== Skin of the Earth

Each area covered by a Meta feature *Data Coverage* must be totally covered by a set of geo features of geometric primitive type surface that do not overlap each other (the Skin of the Earth). Feature types that comprise the Skin of the Earth are listed below:

*Depth Area*

*Dredged Area*

*Land Area*

*Unsurveyed Area*

The geometry of coincident boundaries between Skin of the Earth features in a dataset must not be duplicated.

[[sec_2.5.2]]
==== Discovery metadata

Information regarding discovery metadata can be found in the S-101 ENC Product Specification (main document).

[[sec_2.5.3]]
==== Minimal depiction areas

Where minimal depiction areas exist in a specified ENC optimum display scale, they should be encoded using one of the following options:

[[sec_2.5.3.1]]
===== Wide blank areas

Areas of a dataset which contain no data must be excluded from the area(s) covered by the Meta feature *Data Coverage*. The areas that contain data must be completely covered by *Data Coverage* features.

[[sec_2.5.3.2]]
===== Simplified or minimum depiction areas

* Bathymetry in such areas should be encoded as described in clause 11.9.2.
* Information that does not relate to bathymetry but is relevant to land area features may be encoded.

* One *Caution Area* feature covering the whole area should be created. The complex attributes *information* (sub-attribute *text* or *file reference*) should be encoded using one of the following options (the textual content of the attributes (for *file reference* this will be the contents of the referenced ENC support file) is within quotation marks and italicised):

Where larger scale coverage is available:

"_Most features, including bathymetry, are omitted in this area. The minimal depiction of detail in this area does not support safe navigation; mariners should use a more appropriate scale ENC."_

Any other relevant information pertaining to the area should be incorporated within, or replace completely, the above statement.

Where no larger scale coverage is available:

"_Most features, including bathymetry, are omitted in this area. The minimal depiction of detail in this area does not support safe navigation."_

This statement should be supplemented by additional cautionary information relating to any authority to be consulted before navigating in the area.

[[sec_2.5.4]]
==== Units

The depth, height and positional uncertainty units in a dataset must be metres.

[[sec_2.5.5]]
==== Seamless ENC coverage

ENCs should form a seamless coverage in the navigable waters of the Producer's area of responsibility. However, it is often impractical to do so for all ECDIS display scales, and therefore S-101 ENCs declare a scale range, which dictate between what scales the data can be used.

The Meta feature *Data Coverage* (see clause3.5) is used to provide the ECDIS with the scale information necessary for the determination of dataset loading and unloading in relation to the user selected viewing scale in the ECDIS.

The mandatory attribute *optimum display scale* is used to indicate the intended viewing scale for the data. This may be considered by the Data Producer to be the compilation scale for the data, and is also used as the reference for the overscale indication. The mandatory attribute *minimum display scale* is used to indicate the smallest intended viewing scale for the data. The mandatory attribute *maximum display scale* is used to indicate the value considered by the Data Producer to be the maximum (largest) scale at which the data is to be displayed before it can be considered to be "grossly overscaled".

An ENC dataset (discovery metadata) and associated *Data Coverage* feature(s) must carry a value for *optimum display scale*. Each *Data Coverage* feature must also carry a value for *maximum display scale* and *minimum display scale.* Values for *optimum display scale* and *minimum display scale* must be taken from the list of values defined in Table 3-2 at clause 3.5.1.

The *Data Coverage* features within a dataset must not overlap, however *Data Coverage* features from different datasets may overlap as long as the *optimum display scale* and *minimum display scale* ranges do not overlap and, if populated, they do not have the same value for the attribute *drawing index*. All *Data Coverage* features within a dataset must have the same value for *minimum display scale* and, if populated, **drawing index**, but portions of a dataset can have a different optimum and maximum display scale, depending on the best scale required for navigation in an area for the purpose of the ENC data.

Datasets that share a common minimum display scale will form a seamless presentation when rendered in the end-user system. When datasets do not share a common minimum display scale but are still intended to form a seamless presentation, this should be indicated by using a common drawing index. Datasets with a common minimum display scale or drawing index must not contain overlapping data coverage features.

To ensure a seamless ECDIS display of ENC data within the same scale range, it is important that the data on the border of the dataset is aligned and matched with the corresponding data in any adjoining datasets within the scale range, where possible. Where there is a mismatch in depth data between adjoining datasets, editing of the depth data should be done such that depth contours and depth areas are adjusted on the side of safety. Edge matching of data across different scale ranges, particularly depth data, is often not possible due to generalisation issues resulting from differing scales, although features such as maritime boundaries, navigation lines, recommended tracks, roads etc. should be edge matched where possible. Note that point or curve features which are at the border of *Data Coverage* features (see clause3.5) for adjoining datasets with the same scale range must be part of only one dataset.

In areas which include neighbouring Producer Nations, Hydrographic Offices should co-operate to agree on dataset boundaries and ensure no data overlap within scale ranges, or disparate drawing indices. Where datasets are intended to provide a seamless presentation at national boundaries and a common minimum display scale cannot be agreed, a common drawing index should be agreed. Where possible, adjoining nations should agree on common data boundaries within a technical arrangement based on cartographic convenience and benefit to the Mariner. Suitable communications between neighbouring nations should be put in place to ensure data consistency across dataset boundaries. These should include exchange mechanisms to allow access to each other's ENCs.

[[sec_2.5.6]]
==== Feature Object Identifiers

Each feature instance within an ENC must have a unique universal Feature Object Identifier [FOID]. Information regarding FOIDs can be found in clause 4.4 of the S-101 ENC Product Specification (main document).

[[sec_2.5.7]]
==== Heights and elevations

[[figure_2-2]]
.Heights and elevations
image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_b72f4495.gif[Shape2,528,252]

If it is required to encode the altitude of natural features above a vertical datum (for example hills, coastlines, slopes), with the exception of trees, it must be done using the attribute *elevation* (Figure 2-2&nbsp;(a)).

For artificial features (for example landmarks, buildings) or trees:

* If it is required to encode the altitude of the ground level at the base of the feature, or the elevation of a light, above a vertical datum, it must be done using *elevation* (Figure 2-2 (b)).
* If it is required to encode the altitude of the highest point of the feature above a vertical datum, it must be done using the attribute *height* (Figure 2-2 (c)).
* If it is required to encode the height of the feature above ground level, the seabed or (for floating features) the sea surface (that is, not associated with a vertical datum), it must be done using the attribute *vertical length* (Figure 2-2 (d)).

[[sec_2.5.8]]
==== Geographic names

If it is required to encode a geographic name, or multiple versions of a geographic name including multiple language versions of the name, it must be done using one of more instances of the complex attribute *feature name* (see clause29.2). When possible, existing features (for example **Built-Up Area**, **River**, navigational marks) should be used to carry this information.

If it is required to encode a geographic name for which there is no existing feature, a specific **Administration Area**, *Sea Area/Named Water Area* or *Land Region* feature must be created (see clauses 16.8, 9.1 and 5.11 respectively). In order to minimise the data volume, these features should, where possible, use the geometry of existing features, for example a *Sea Area/Named Water Area* feature may use the geometry of a *Depth Area* feature.

Geographic names can be left in their original language in a non-English iteration of the sub-attribute **name**, or transliterated or transcribed and used in an English iteration of the sub-attribute **name**, in which case the original name should be populated in an additional iteration of *feature name* with the mandatory sub-attribute *language* populated with the relevant three-letter language code in accordance with ISO 639-2/T. Examples of encoding of *feature name* are included in Table 2-5 below. General conventions for the population of *feature name* for an encoded feature instance are as follows:

* Where it is intended that a name of a feature instance is to be displayed in the ECDIS, one or more iterations of *feature name* must be encoded for the feature, with exactly one of these instances having the sub-attribute *name usage* = _1_ (default name display). This should normally be the English version of the name (mandatory attribute *language* = _eng_), however this is at the discretion of the Data Producer.
* Where only a single instance of *feature name* and having sub-attribute *name usage* = _1_ is encoded for a feature instance, this name will be displayed in both the "default" ECDIS language setting and the "alternate" ECDIS language setting.
* Multiple instances of *feature name* may be encoded for any language, and/or for multiple languages. Where multiple instances of *feature name* are encoded for a feature instance, they must be encoded as follows in order to ensure the desired ECDIS display in both the default and alternate ECDIS language display settings:

** If the name is intended to be displayed in the "default" ECDIS display, exactly one of instance of *feature name* having the sub-attribute *name usage* = _1_ (default name display) must be included. Where other instances of *feature name* having the same value for the mandatory attribute *language* have been encoded, the attribute *name usage* must not be populated.
** If an alternate language name is intended to be displayed in the "alternate" ECDIS language setting, at least one instance of *feature name* having attribute *language* populated with a value other than the "default" language must be encoded, and having the value for the sub-attribute *name usage* = _2_ (alternate name display). Only one *feature name* instance having *name usage* = _2_ can be encoded for a single language; and for all *feature name* instances having an instance(s) of *name usage* = _2_ there must be a feature instance having *name usage* = _1_ encoded as the "default" language instance.
** Where the language(s) selected by the Mariner as the "alternate" language(s) is different from the alternate language(s) encoded for a feature instance, the "default" name will be displayed at all times.
** If it is required to restrict the display of all instances of *feature name* encoded for a feature instance only to the ECDIS Pick Report, *name usage* must not be populated for any instance.
** All encoded instances of *feature name* will be included in the ECDIS Pick Report.
* Reasons for encoding more than one instance of *feature name* for a particular language include (but are not limited to):

** For cartographic reasons, for example to abbreviate a name using an international abbreviation.
** To allow an identifier/designator to be displayed in preference to the name of the feature (for example on aids to navigation).

In the following examples, a dash in the *name usage* sub-attribute column indicates that the sub-attribute must not be populated.

Geographic names should be encoded using *feature name* based on the following criteria and at the Producing Authority's discretion:

. Named points or capes that do not contain navigational aids should be encoded as *Land Region* features (of type surface or point), with the geographic name encoded using *feature name*.
. Named points or capes that contain one navigational aid should be encoded using *feature name* on the structure feature associated with the navigational aid. If more than one navigational aid exists on the point or cape or if the point or cape and the structure feature have different names, a *Land Region* feature (of type surface or point) should be encoded, with the geographic name of the point or cape encoded using *feature name*.
. A group of hydrographic features (for example **Seabed Area**, **Underwater/Awash Rock**, **Obstruction**, *Sounding*), associated with a particular geographic name, should have the name encoded using *feature name* on a *Sea Area/Named Water Area* feature (of type surface or point). The name should not be encoded on the individual hydrographic features.
. A major island name close to primary shipping corridors should be encoded using *feature name* on the *Land Area* feature delimiting the island.
. A named island group or archipelago should be encoded using *feature name* on an *Island Group* feature (see clause5.5). Where individual islands within the group are named, these should be encoded using *feature name* on the *Land Area* feature delimiting the island.
. Named features listed in Hydrographic Office's Sailing Directions that may assist in navigation should be encoded using *feature name* on the relevant feature (for example **Land Region**, **Underwater/Awash Rock**, **Seabed Area**, **Sea Area/Named Water Area**, *Obstruction*).
. If it is required to encode an administrative area of international, national, provincial or municipal jurisdiction that may have legal inference, it must be done using an *Administration Area* feature, with the name encoded using *feature name*.
. If it is required to encode a major city along the coast, it must be done using *Built-Up Area* or *Administration Area* features (see clause 6.1), with the name encoded using *feature name*.
. If it is required to encode the name of a navigable river, lake or canal, it must be done using a *Sea Area/Named Water Area* feature, with the name encoded using *feature name*.
. If it is required to encode the name of a beach and no intertidal area exists, it should be done using *feature name* for the section of sandy coast (*Coastline* with *nature of surface* = _4_ (sand)) representing the beach. If the extent of the beach cannot be determined from the source, then the name should be encoded using *Land Region*. When an intertidal area (*Depth Area*) exists in the area covered by the named beach, the name of the beach should be encoded using *feature name* for a *Sea Area* feature covering the intertidal area.

In all instances, if the exact extent of the feature to be named is known, a surface feature must be created. If the exact extent is not known, or the area is too small at the optimum display scale of the ENC dataset, an existing or specifically encoded point feature should be used to encode the geographic name.

[[sec_2.5.8.1]]
===== Text placement

The cartographic feature *Text Placement* (see clause23.1) is used specifically to place text cartographically. The properties of the text placement feature are described as follows;

*Geometry (point)* – the spatial point location of the text string.

*text type* – the classification of the text being placed based on attribution of the target feature(s) (mandatory).

*text offset bearing* and *text offset distance* – the bearing and distance (in millimetres in the ECDIS display) used to position the text relative to the feature.

The *Text Placement* feature is associated to the feature which carries the text being placed. The mandatory attribute *text type* identifies the text string(s) to be placed. The *Text Placement* feature may provide functionality such that, as an ECDIS screen rotates from its optimum position in "north up" display mode (for example, if display is set to "course up") text can remain readable, or clear other important charted information.

[[sec_2.5.9]]
==== Sample scale minimum policy

The following policy for the application of *scale minimum* (see clause 27.156) to an ENC portfolio is based on the mandatory *optimum display scale* values listed in clause 3.5.1. While the procedure described below to determine the *scale minimum* value for features in an ENC cell is recommended, the *scale minimum* values used are at the discretion of the Producing Authority. Authorities should cooperate at the regional or RENC level to determine a *scale minimum* policy that results in suitable and consistent display of ENC data for the Mariner across and, where required between, regions.

*scale minimum* values used must be selected from the following list:

* *scale minimum* values for features within an ENC should be set to either 1, 2, 3 or 4 steps smaller scale than the optimum display scale of the ENC data.
* Table 2-7 below lists the step values (that is 1, 2, 3 or 4) that may be applied for specific feature classes together with any relevant conditions and additional flexibilities. NOTE: The Table does not include features for which *scale minimum* is not an allowable attribute.

Following this process provides an automated approach to setting *scale minimum* which takes account of the relative importance of different feature classes, and will achieve sufficient de-cluttering even where there are large gaps in the scales of coverage available.

Unless the step values outlined in Table 2-7 have been manually adjusted, this approach takes no direct account of the relative importance of individual occurrences of a feature, and may result in the situation where a feature disappears and then reappears as the user zooms out on their ECDIS display. To address these remaining issues, the following additional process steps should be applied:

* Linear and area features (excluding those features subject to extensive generalisation for example *Depth Contour*) that extend beyond the coverage of a dataset and exist in an overlapping smaller scale dataset should be assigned the same *scale minimum* value as the *scale minimum* value of the corresponding feature in the smaller scale dataset.
* The *scale minimum* value of an individual occurrence of a feature should be set to either 1, 2, 3 or 4 steps smaller scale than the optimum display scale of the smallest scale ENC that the feature would appear on (that is, assuming full coverage across all optimum display scale values).

The following notes apply to Table 2-7 below:

. Producers should be prepared to deviate from the step values specified when the significance of the feature dictates, for example the recommended number of steps for a *Light* feature is 4, but there will be circumstances where a *Light* feature is so important that no *scale minimum* value be applied; alternatively, the light could be so minor that a step value of 1 can be applied.
. *Scale minimum* should only be applied to navigational aids where they contribute to "screen clutter" and where their removal from the display does not constitute a risk to safe navigation.
. It is generally accepted that features making up a navigational aid will have the same attributes, and therefore features within a *Structure/Equipment* association (see clause 25.16) should be assigned the same *scale minimum* value.
. The elements comprising a range system (see clause 15.1.1) should have the same *scale minimum* value, which should be the value corresponding to the largest step value of the features comprising the range system. For instance, for a range system comprising a **Navigation Line**, *Recommended Track* and navigation aids, the decision may be not to apply *scale minimum* to the navigation aids (in accordance to Note 2 above), in which case the *Navigation Line* and *Recommended Track* should also not have *scale minimum* applied. Similarly, all features comprising a routeing measure (see clause 10.2) should have the same *scale minimum* value.
. Where features having curve or surface geometry extend over multiple *Data Coverage* areas (see clause 3.5), the value for *scale minimum* should be populated based on the largest scale denominator populated for the attribute *optimum display scale* on the underlying *Data Coverage* areas. The same approach should also be considered for items included in feature associations such as range systems and routeing measures, also taking into account Note 4 above.

==== Masking

To improve the look and feel of the display of ENCs in ECDIS for the Mariner certain edges of features should be masked (see S-101 Product Specification Main document clause4.8.3). For example, the boundaries of anchorage area symbols overwrite coincident pontoon symbols:

[[figure_2-3]]
.Overwriting symbols – Example
image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_993c3668.jpg["",484,145]

In order to best determine the appropriate level of masking required for an ENC cell, it is recommended that the ENC be viewed in an ECDIS.

The following scenarios where masking is recommended should be considered by compilers;

1. Surface features crossing ENC cell boundaries:

When a single feature of type surface crosses the boundaries of adjoining ENC cells, mask the edge where it shares the geometry of the boundary in each ENC:

[[figure_2-4]]
.Surface feature crossing ENC cell boundaries
image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_7dffabf3.jpg["",537,152]

This allows the features to be displayed as a single feature of type surface rather than being divided at the cell boundary and having the representation of two separate features. Note that some ENC production software will automatically truncate (mask) features at the cell boundary.

NOTE: Occasionally an edge of the boundary of an area actually coincides with the ENC cell boundary. Where this occurs and the ENC production system applies automatic truncation (masking) of this edge, the compiler must "unmask" that edge so as to avoid the appearance of the area to be "open ended".

Where features of type surface extend beyond the entire limit of data coverage for the ENC cell (see clause 3.5), all edges of these area features should be masked:

[[figure_2-5]]
.Surface features extending beyond the entire limit of data coverage
image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_91d0c770.jpg["",391,92]

Where a cell contains an area of no data coverage and the ENC production software applies automatic truncation (masking) of features extending beyond the limit of data coverage of the ENC, edges of area features extending beyond the internal limit of the area of no data coverage may need to be masked manually.

Table 2-9 below lists those features of type surface that should have edges masked where the boundary of the area crosses or extends beyond the ENC cell limit or the area of data coverage of the ENC cell.

. Surface features having ECDIS symbol pattern fill:

Surfaces symbolised in ECDIS with a patterned fill, and for which the outer edge of the surface has no significance (or is subject to change or intermittent), for example *Vegetation* (see Figure 2-6 below) or *Water Turbulence* features, may have the boundary of the surface masked to reduce screen clutter.

[[figure_2-6]]
.Surface feature with pattern fill
image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_599b1d0a.png["",602,156]

Compilers must take care that the surface is large enough at the optimum display scale of the ENC data (and at smaller optimum display scales at which it is intended that the feature should be displayed) so that at least one pattern symbol is displayed in the area. If this is not the case, the boundary of the surface should not be masked. Alternatively, a point feature may be encoded instead of the surface feature. It may be useful to load and display the ENC in an ECDIS in order to assist with making decisions as to the best encoding option to adopt in individual circumstances.

3. Routeing measures – entrance and exit edges:

Routeing measures such as Traffic Separation Schemes (TSS), Two-Way Routes and Deep Water Routes have defined "ends" through which vessels enter and exit the route. Most routeing measures also consist of multiple components having different orientations. Where encoded, many of the features comprising the routeing measure symbolise along the edges of the area. Where the edges corresponding to the entry/exit points and between individual components of the route have not been masked, the impression of the route as a single routeing measure may not be apparent to the Mariner, and cause confusion. Compilers should therefore mask the entry/exit edges, and all edges between components within the routeing measure.

Table 2-10 below lists those area features that should have entry/exit edges, and all edges between components within the routeing measure masked.

Figure 2-7 below shows an example of a TSS with all appropriate edges of the components of the TSS masked.

[[fig_2-7]]
.Traffic Separation Scheme with appropriate masking
image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_fe6cab30.png["",377,264]

To give an indication of the effect of masking in a complex area such as a maritime area containing a TSS, Figure 2-7 includes a *Caution Area* feature of type surface which has not had its edges masked. Due to the existence of the magenta "!" symbols within the **Caution Area**, and the fact that the edges of the *Caution Area* are coincident with the outer edge of the TSS, it is possible to further reduce ECDIS display clutter by masking the edges of the *Caution Area*. The resultant ECDIS display can be seen in Figure 2-8 below.

[[fig_2-8]]
.Traffic Separation Scheme with masked Caution Area
image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_9447974f.gif[Shape3,388,248]

NOTE: In the example above it is also possible to mask the areas of water turbulence (indicated in Figure 2-8 by red arrows – see scenario 2 above), however the small area to the east of the West cardinal buoy is too small to display the symbol at the optimum display scale of the ENC data. In cases such as this the compiler should consider capturing this as a *Water Turbulence* feature of type point.

== Metadata Features

The maximum use must be made of Meta features to reduce the attribution on individual features. In a Base dataset (see S-101 Annex B, clauseB5), some Meta features are mandatory.

These mandatory Meta features are in the following list:

*Data Coverage:* In order to assist in data discovery, the Meta feature *Data Coverage* must be used to provide coverage of the part of the dataset covered by Skin of the Earth features. See clause 3.5.

*Navigational System of Marks:* The Meta feature *Navigational System of Marks* must provide an exhaustive non-overlapping coverage of the *Data Coverage* feature(s). See clause 3.6.

*Quality of Bathymetric Data:* The Meta feature *Quality of Bathymetric Data* defines areas within which uniform assessment exists for the quality of bathymetric data, and is used to provide an assessment of the overall quality of bathymetric data to the Mariner. Areas of a dataset at optimum display scale 1:700000 and larger containing depth data or bathymetry must be covered by one or more *Quality of Bathymetric Data* features, which may overlap vertically (see clause 3.8.1). At optimum display scales smaller than 1:700000, *Quality of Bathymetric Data* features are optional. NOTE: Where a dataset does not contain any depth data or bathymetry, it is not required to encode *Quality of Bathymetric Data*.

*Sounding Datum:* The Meta feature *Sounding Datum* must provide an exhaustive non-overlapping coverage of the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature(s). See clause 3.9. NOTE: Where a dataset does not contain any depth data or bathymetry, it is not required to encode *Sounding Datum*.

*Vertical Datum of Data:* The Meta feature *Vertical Datum of Data* must provide an exhaustive non-overlapping coverage of the *Data Coverage* feature(s). See clause 3.10.

[[sec_3.1]]
=== Horizontal uncertainty

The attributes *quality of horizontal measurement* and *horizontal position uncertainty* may be applied to any spatial type, in order to qualify the location of a feature.

If it is required to encode the uncertainty of a horizontal clearance (complex attributes *horizontal clearance fixed* and *horizontal clearance open*), it must be done using the sub-attribute *horizontal distance uncertainty*.

*horizontal distance uncertainty* applies only to *horizontal clearance fixed* and *horizontal clearance open*. There is no attribute to express the accuracy of the attributes *horizontal length* and *horizontal width*.

*horizontal distance uncertainty* and *quality of horizontal measurement* must not be applied to the spatial type of any geo feature if they are identical to the *horizontal distance uncertainty* and *quality of horizontal measurement* values of the underlying Meta feature. *horizontal position uncertainty* must not be applied to the spatial type of any geo feature if it is identical to the *horizontal position uncertainty* value(s) of the underlying Meta feature, except for *Sounding* and *Underwater/Awash Rock* features; and **Foul Ground**, **Marine Farm/Culture**, *Obstruction* and *Wreck* features of type point (see clauses 3.8.1.3, 11.3, 13.4-7 and 13.10).

*quality of horizontal measurement* gives qualitative information, whereas *horizontal position uncertainty* gives quantitative information.

[underline]#Remarks:#

No remarks.

[[sec_3.2]]
=== Vertical uncertainty

If it is required to encode the uncertainty of a vertical clearance (complex attributes *vertical***clearance fixed**, **vertical clearance open**, *vertical clearance closed* and *vertical clearance safe*), it must be done using the complex sub-attribute *vertical uncertainty* (see clause 29.40).

If several vertical clearances are given for one feature, the uncertainty given must be that of the least accurate.

[underline]#Remarks:#

No remarks.

|===

\* The information type **Spatial Quality**, attributes *horizontal position uncertainty* and **vertical uncertainty**, may be associated to *Quality of Bathymetric Data* using the information to feature association *Quality of Bathymetric Data Composition* (see clause 25.12).

\*\* As populated on an associated instance of the information type **Spatial Quality**, using the information to feature association *Spatial Association* (see clause 25.15).

Features and attributes shown in grey text in Table 3-1 above do not play an active role in regard to ECDIS display and/or performance in terms of hierarchy of the encoding. However, where both the S-101 Meta feature and the attribute for the Geo feature are encoded, end-user interpretation of the ECDIS Pick Report is that the value populated for the attribute on the Geo feature provides the relevant value.

It is prohibited to use an attribute on an individual object, if this attribute has the same value as the general value defined by the Meta feature.

==== Coverage

The Meta feature *Data Coverage* encodes the area covered by data within the dataset. This feature is also used to provide the ECDIS with the scale information necessary for the determination of dataset loading and rendering (display) in relation to the user selected viewing scale in the ECDIS. There must be a minimum of one *Data Coverage* feature in the dataset. *Data Coverage* features must cover the equivalent area to the extent of the spatial types in the dataset, and must not overlap (see clause2.5.1).Where populated, all *Data Coverage* features in the dataset must have the same value for the attribute **drawing index**, as datasets that share a common drawing index are intended to form a seamless presentation, regardless of the populated value(s) for minimum display scale. *Data Coverage* features which share a common drawing index must not overlap.The mandatory attribute *optimum display scale* is used to indicate the intended viewing scale for the data. The value populated for **optimum display scale**, therefore, provides a reference for the user selected viewing scale in the ECDIS at which the overscale warning will be displayed as the Mariner continues to zoom in if there is no larger optimum display scale ENC dataset available.The mandatory attribute *minimum display scale* is used to indicate the smallest intended viewing scale for the data where a full portfolio of ENCs is available; and provides the reference scale that defines a "series" of ENCs covering a geographic area intended to be displayed seamlessly. Where an empty (null) value is populated for **minimum display scale**, the ECDIS will continue to display the data regardless of how small the user selected viewing scale becomes. The value populated for **minimum display scale**, therefore, is intended to be used in a series of ENC cells covering a geographic area to determine the dataset rendering (display) priority as the user selected viewing scale becomes larger.The mandatory attribute *maximum display scale* is used to indicate the scale at which the Data Producer considers that the "grossly overscaled" warning is to be triggered based on the user selected viewing scale.For ENC, in order to provide a consistent relationship between the encoded data and the way the data is displayed in ECDIS, the values for **maximum display scale**, *minimum display scale* and *optimum display scale* must be taken from the values listed in the following Table:

[NOTE: The selection of values for *maximum display scale* and *minimum display scale* for any selected *optimum display scale* are at the discretion of the Data Producer. That is, any value listed for *maximum display scale* and *minimum display scale* above may be selected from any of the listed values, with the only restriction being that *maximum display scale* must be a smaller value than/equal to *optimum display scale* which must be a smaller value than *minimum display scale* (or any value if *minimum display scale* is populated with an empty (null) value).]Typically, only a single *Data Coverage* feature should be used in a dataset. However, if the optimum display scale is different for discrete areas within a single ENC dataset, this must be indicated by encoding separate, non-overlapping *Data Coverage* features, each having a different value populated for *optimum display scale*. Producing Authorities are to note, however, that excessive use of multiple *Data Coverage* features having different values of *optimum display scale* within a single dataset should be avoided. Where different values of *optimum display scale* are used, this should be restricted only to data compiled in order to achieve the intended navigational usage for the entire dataset. Datasets must have the same value for *minimum display scale* for all *Data Coverage* features in the dataset. Datasets may have different values populated for *maximum display scale* for the *Data Coverage* features in the dataset; these values are typically populated as the value corresponding to 2 x the scale (or half the denominator) value populated for *optimum display scale* (this will replicate the corresponding gross overscale indication as implemented in S-57/S-52), but are at the discretion of the Data Producer. For example, the value for *maximum display scale* may be set to the same value as *optimum display scale* to have the "grossly overscaled" warning appear at any larger user selected viewing scale than **optimum display scale**; or populated as the value corresponding to the *minimum display scale* value for the next largest scale dataset(s) in the ENC portfolio.Where a series of differing optimum display scale ENC datasets are compiled covering the same geographic area, the smallest scale value populated for *optimum display scale* for *Data Coverage* feature(s) in the dataset should correspond to the **minimum display scale**, where populated, for the next largest optimum display scale ENC dataset. The largest scale value populated for *optimum display scale* for *Data Coverage* feature(s) in the dataset must not be a larger scale value than the *optimum display scale* for the next largest optimum display scale ENC dataset, where such a dataset exists.

Remarks:

* This Meta feature is intended to support an indication of coverage; and facilitates the loading and rendering (display) of datasets in the end-user system.
* Where more than one *Data Coverage* feature exists for a dataset, the dataset, when initially loaded, will be displayed in the ECDIS at a display scale corresponding to the largest scale value populated for *optimum display scale*.
* Where a dataset consists of only one *Data Coverage* feature, the value for the optimum display scale populated in the dataset discovery metadata must be the same as the value populated for *optimum display scale* on the *Data Coverage*.
* Except for the largest scale dataset coverage, datasets with multiple *Data Coverage* features must not have excessive differences in the values populated for *optimum display scale* between the *Data Coverage* features. Typically, this should be interpreted as there being no more than one scale step value as defined in Table 3-2 above between the *optimum display scale* values in a single dataset.

INT 1 Reference:

[[sec_3.8.1]]
==== Quality, reliability and uncertainty of bathymetric data (see S-4 – B-297)

Information about quality, reliability and uncertainty of bathymetric data is given using:

* the Meta feature *Quality of Bathymetric Data* and, if required, an associated instance of the Information type *Spatial Quality* (see clause 24.5) for an overall assessment of the quality of bathymetric data;
* the Meta feature *Quality of Survey* for additional information about individual surveys (see clause3.11);
* the attributes *quality of vertical measurement* and *technique of vertical measurement* on groups of soundings or individual features;
* the attributes *horizontal* **position uncertainty**, *quality of horizontal measurement* and *vertical uncertainty* on the spatial types (see clauses 2.4.7 and 24.5).
Bathymetric data quality comprises the following:

** completeness of data (for example, seafloor coverage);
** currency of data (for example, temporal degradation);
** uncertainty of data;
** source of data.

For the Mariner, *Quality of Bathymetric Data* provides the most useful information. Therefore, the use of *Quality of Bathymetric Data* is mandatory for areas containing depth data or bathymetry on ENC datasets at optimum display scale 1:700000 and larger.

In order to provide an indication of the horizontal position and vertical accuracies of the features to which it applies, instances of *Quality of Bathymetric Data* must have the sub-complex attributes *horizontal position uncertainty* and *vertical uncertainty* populated on **Quality of Bathymetric Data**, or alternately on an associated instance of the information type *Spatial Quality* (see clause 24.5), using the association *Quality of Bathymetric Data Composition* (see clause 25.12).

More detailed information about a survey may be given using *Quality of Survey* (see clause3.11). For example, in incompletely surveyed areas, lines of passage soundings may be indicated as such using a curve *Quality of Survey* feature. This information is more difficult for the Mariner to interpret, therefore the use of *Quality of Survey* is optional.

For individual features (wrecks, obstructions etc), or individual/small groups of soundings, **quality of vertical measurement**, **technique of vertical measurement**, *horizontal position uncertainty* and *vertical uncertainty* may be used to provide additional information about quality and uncertainty.

The Meta feature *Quality of Bathymetric Data* defines areas within which uniform assessment exists for the quality of bathymetric data, and must be used, where required, to provide an assessment of the overall quality of bathymetric data to the Mariner. Therefore, areas of a dataset containing depth data or bathymetry at optimum display scale 1:700000 and larger must be covered by one or more **Quality of Bathymetric Data**, which may overlap vertically in order to define the quality of bathymetric data at varying depths in the water column.

__**Figure 3-2 – Adjoining and overlapping Quality of Bathymetric Data features**__
image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_febf43c2.png["",657,402]

Figure 3-2 above demonstrates the encoding for varying quality of bathymetric data in the water column, in this example a mechanically swept area to a depth of 5 metres that has also been previously surveyed using single beam echo sounder to the seabed. For the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature that defines the data quality for the swept area, it is important to note that the recommended attribution shown above is intended to provide the highest (best) quality indicator for vessels navigating at a safety depth of less than 5 metres in the area. For vessels navigating at a safety depth of greater than 5 metres in the area, or at any depth outside the area, the lower quality indicator will be provided.

NOTE: Figure 3-2 demonstrates the two options for the encoding of the horizontal position and vertical uncertainties available in S-101. For the area covered by the swept area, the varying horizontal position and vertical uncertainties in the water column are encoded using the sub-complex attributes *horizontal position uncertainty* and *vertical uncertainty* on the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* features. For the two areas covered only by the single beam echo sounder survey to the seabed, the horizontal position and vertical uncertainties are encoded using the sub-complex attributes *horizontal position uncertainty* and *vertical uncertainty* on an associated *Spatial Quality* feature (which may be a single *Spatial Quality* feature associated to both *Quality of Bathymetric Data* features). See the Remarks below and clause 24.5.

Remarks:

* The mandatory attribute *data assessment* provides an overall indicative level of assessment of bathymetric data from which further attribution is derived, and assists with portrayal of bathymetric data quality information in ECDIS:

** Where the value for *data assessment* is set to _1_ (assessed), all additional attribution for the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature must be indicative of the quality of bathymetric data for the area.
** Where the value for *data assessment* is set to _2_ (assessed (oceanic)), all additional attribution for the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature should be indicative of the quality of bathymetric data for the area for a Mariner's ECDIS pick report, however no portrayal of the quality information will display on the ECDIS. This value should only be used to cover open ocean (oceanic) depths in waters deeper than 200 metres.
** [[OLE_LINK11]][[OLE_LINK10]]Where the value for *data assessment* is set to _3_ (unassessed), the mandatory attributes *category of temporal variation* = _6_ (unassessed); *features detected* (*least depth of detected features measured* and *significant features detected*) = __False__; *full seafloor coverage achieved* = __False__; and *category of zone of confidence in data* = _6_ (zone of confidence U); and *horizontal position uncertainty* (*uncertainty fixed*) and *vertical uncertainty* (*uncertainty fixed*) on *Quality of Bathymetric Data* or the associated *Spatial Quality* = empty (null) must be populated.
* Wherever possible, meaningful and useful values for the attributes **category of temporal variation**, **full seafloor coverage achieved**, and the complex attribute *features detected* must be used for areas of bathymetry. For areas of unstable seafloors, the complex attribute *survey date range* (*date end*) should be used to indicate the date of the survey of the underlying bathymetric data.
* As a result of some disasters, for example earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, it is possible that large areas of seafloor have moved and/or become cluttered with dangerous obstructions. Emergency surveys may subsequently be conducted over essential shipping routes and inside harbours. Outside these surveys, all existing detail is now suspect, whatever the quality of the previous surveys. In such cases, the attribute *category of temporal variation* should be reclassified to value _1_ (extreme event), the Boolean attribute *full seafloor coverage achieved* set to __False__; complex attribute **features detected**, Boolean sub-attributes *least depth of detected features measured* and *significant features detected* set to __False__; the *zone of confidence* sub-attribute *category of zone of confidence in data* reclassified to _5_ (zone of confidence D); and the sub-attributes *horizontal position accuracy* (*uncertainty fixed*) and *vertical uncertainty* (*uncertainty fixed*) on *Quality of Bathymetric Data* or the associated *Spatial Quality*populated with an empty (null) value in the affected areas outside the area covered by emergency surveys.
* To express completeness of bathymetric data, the complex attribute *features detected* must be encoded. *features detected* indicates that a systematic method of exploring the seafloor, or the water column to the depth indicated by population of the attribute **depth range maximum value**, was undertaken to detect significant features. The sub-attributes *size of features detected* and *least depth of detected features measured* must not be encoded unless the sub-attribute *significant features detected* is set to _True_.
* The mandatory complex attribute *zone of confidence*is used on a *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature to provide an overall indication of the accuracy of the bathymetric data in the area; and may be used to specify the vertical and horizontal position uncertainty of the depths covered by the surface. Where *category of temporal variation* is set to values _2_ (likely to change and significant shoaling expected) or _3_ (likely to change but significant shoaling not expected), multiple instances of the complex attribute *zone of confidence* should be encoded to provide an indication of the degradation of the overall accuracy as well as the vertical and horizontal position uncertainty of the charted bathymetric information over time.

** Wherever possible, meaningful and useful values of the mandatory sub-attribute *category of zone of confidence in data* should be used (that is, values other than *category of zone of confidence in data* = _6_ (zone of confidence U)) for areas of bathymetry. These values must be determined from the *category of zone of confidence in data* definition table (see clause 27.74) in accordance with the values populated for the attribute **full seafloor coverage achieved**,the complex attribute *features detected* and the sub-complex attributes *horizontal position uncertainty* and *vertical uncertainty* on the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* or the associated *Spatial Quality* (see the following Remarks bullet).
** The sub-complex attribute *fixed date range* is used to define the date range(s) where the quality is degraded over time. Where multiple date ranges are specified, the *date start* of an instance must be equal to the *date end* of the previous instance. Within the sequence, the *date start* of the first instance and the *date end* of the last instance should not be populated; the values populated for *fixed date range* must not result in the removal of the indication of bathymetric data quality for an area from the Mariner.
* The sub-complex attributes *horizontal position uncertainty* and *vertical uncertainty* must be encoded using either *Quality of Bathymetric Data* or the Information feature *Spatial Quality* (see clause 24.5). The decision as to which option to use should be based on whether the horizontal position and vertical uncertainty values are specific to a single *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature or relates to multiple *Quality of Bathymetric Data* features. In general, specific values are related to areas of changeable bathymetry over time or varying bathymetric data quality in the water column (as shown in Figure 3-2 above); and repeating values are specific to general quality uncertainty values in non-changeable areas. It is prohibited to use both options for a single *Quality of Bathymetric Data* instance.

** *vertical uncertainty* on the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* or the associated *Spatial Quality* is used to specify the vertical uncertainty of the depths covered by the surface within a specified date range (where encoded); and should be adjusted to indicate the degradation of the vertical uncertainty over time where multiple instances of *zone of confidence* are encoded (see above bullet). When *depth range minimum value* is specified on **Quality of Bathymetric Data**, *vertical uncertainty* refers only to the uncertainty of the swept depth defined by *depth range minimum value*.
** *horizontal position uncertainty* on the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* or the associated *Spatial Quality* is used to specify the positional uncertainty of the depths covered by the surface within a specified date range (where encoded); and should be adjusted to indicate the degradation of the horizontal position uncertainty over time where multiple instances of *zone of confidence* are encoded (see above).
* *depth range minimum value* must only be used on a *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature where a swept area occupies the entire *Quality of Bathymetric Data* surface, or *Quality of Bathymetric Data* features overlap. Where these features overlap such that varying bathymetric data qualities exist at different depths in the water column, the *depth range minimum value* for a *Quality of Bathymetric Data* must be set to a value 0.1 metres deeper than the *depth range maximum value* for the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature defining the quality for the level above; and the topmost *Quality of Bathymetric Data* must have *depth range minimum value* set to an empty (null) value (see Figure 3-2 above).
* *depth range maximum value* must only be used on a *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature to specify the maximum depth to which all other attributes for the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature applies. When *depth range maximum value* is specified, values populated for all other attributes apply only to depths equal to or shoaler than *depth range maximum value*. No quality information is provided for depths deeper than *depth range maximum value*. Where *Quality of Bathymetric Data* features overlap such that varying bathymetric data qualities exist at different depths in the water column, the *depth range maximum value* for a *Quality of Bathymetric Data* must be set to a value 0.1 metres shoaler than the *depth range minimum value* for the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature defining the quality for the level below; and the bottommost *Quality of Bathymetric Data* must have *depth range maximum value* set to an empty (null) value (see Figure 3-2 above).
* *Quality of Bathymetric Data* must be encoded over *Unsurveyed Area* features that contain any depth data or bathymetry (depth contours, obstructions, soundings, underwater rocks, wrecks); and must have mandatory attributes *data assessment* = _1_ (assessed) *category of temporal variation* = _6_ (unassessed); *features detected* (*least depth of detected features measured* and *significant features detected*) = __False__; *full seafloor coverage achieved* = __False__; and *zone of confidence* (*category of zone of confidence in data*) = _5_ (zone of confidence D). The *vertical uncertainty* (*uncertainty fixed*) and *horizontal position uncertainty* (*uncertainty fixed*)for the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* or the associated *Spatial Quality* should be populated with an empty (null) value.
* For *Unsurveyed Area* features that do not contain any depth data or bathymetry, it is not required to encode a *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature that covers the area.

* If the attribute *technique of vertical measurement*is required, it must be encoded on either the Meta feature *Quality of Survey* (see clause 3.11) or on individual geo features (for example *Sounding*).

* When the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* surface contains data from only one survey, the date of survey should be specified using the complex attribute **survey date range**, sub-attribute *date end*. When the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* surface contains data from two or more surveys, the date of the most recent and the oldest survey should be specified using the complex attribute *survey date range*.
* *Quality of Bathymetric Data* areas must not be encoded over land.
* *Spatial Quality* (*horizontal position uncertainty*) associated to the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* using the association *Quality of Bathymetric Data Composition* (see clause 25.12), where encoded, applies to bathymetric data situated within the surface, while *Spatial Quality* (*quality of horizontal measurement*) or (*horizontal position uncertainty*) on the associated spatial types using the association *Spatial Association* (see clause 24.5) qualifies the location of the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature itself.
* Meta features *Quality of Bathymetric Data* and *Quality of Non-Bathymetric Data*may overlap.
* Additional quality information may be given using the Meta feature *Quality of Survey*.

[[sec_3.8.1.1]]
===== Temporal variation

The indication of degrading quality of bathymetry over time should be encoded using multiple instances of the complex attribute *zone of confidence* where required (see 5^th^ to 8^th^ bullet points in clause 3.8.1 above).

The changeability of the bathymetry must be encoded using *category of temporal variation*. In order for a time reference to be given for the expression of temporal variation, the relevant dates of the bathymetric data should be encoded using the complex attribute *survey date range* if *category of temporal variation* is set to _1_ (extreme event), _2_ (likely to change and significant shoaling expected) or _3_ (likely to change but significant shoaling not expected). Consideration should be given, in particular, for the encoding of *survey data range* if multiple instances of *zone of confidence* are not encoded to provide an indication of the degradation of the overall accuracy of the charted bathymetric information over time, in order to provide the Mariner with a temporal frame of reference for decision making.

[[sec_3.8.1.2]]
===== Feature detection

In the context of bathymetry, a feature is any object, whether manmade or not, projecting above the seafloor, which may be considered a danger to surface navigation. Refer to IHO Publication S-44.

The ability to detect bathymetric features must be encoded using the complex attribute *features detected*. The sub-attribute *significant features detected* indicates whether the survey was capable of detecting features of a size indicated by the sub-attribute *size of features detected*. The sub-attribute *least depth of detected features measured* indicates whether the least depth of detected features was found. For instance, if a wreck was found, but it is not certain that the least depth of that wreck was measured, *least depth of detected features measured* must be set to _False_.

[[sec_3.8.1.3]]
===== Sounding uncertainty

Sounding uncertainty is encoded using the complex attribute **zone of confidence**, sub-complex attribute *vertical uncertainty* on **Quality of Bathymetric Data**; or alternatively using an associated instance of the information type **Spatial Quality**, complex attribute *spatial accuracy* (see clause 24.5) and using the association *Quality of Bathymetric Data Composition* (see clause 25.12). If it is required to encode additional sounding uncertainty information, it must be done using the attributes *quality of vertical measurement* and *technique of vertical measurement* on groups of soundings or individual features; or by associating another instance of the information type *Spatial Quality* to the spatial type associated with the individual geo features.

The vertical and horizontal position uncertainty values populated on the instance of *Quality of Bathymetric Data* or the associated *Spatial Quality* must reflect the most commonly associated values for the **Obstruction**, **Sounding**, *Underwater/Awash Rock* and *Wreck* features within the area.

==== Sounding datum

For depth information that is encoded using the attributes **value of sounding**, **depth range minimum value**, *depth range maximum value* and *value of depth contour* the sounding datum is encoded using the Meta feature **Sounding Datum**, and must be constant over large areas.

All parts of the dataset containing depth data or bathymetry must be covered by *Sounding Datum* features, with the attribute *vertical datum* indicating the sounding datum. *Sounding Datum* features must not overlap.

For sounding features (*Sounding* and *Depth – No Bottom Found*) both the position and depth information is encoded by means of coordinates, with the depth information stored in the Z-coordinate. The sounding datum is defined by the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) for the Z-Coordinate ("Coordinate in Z Axis" [ZCOO] subfield of the "3-D Integer Coordinate Tuple" [C3IT] field or the "3-D Integer Coordinate List" [C3IL] field).

The definition of the CRS is stored in the "Dataset Coordinate Reference System" record and referred by the "Vertical CRS Id" [VCID] subfield of the "3-D Integer Coordinate Tuple" [C3IT] field or the "3-D Integer Coordinate List" [C3IL] field.

The CRS for the Z-coordinate should also have the subfield "Axis Type" [AXTY] of the corresponding "Coordinate System Axes" [CSAX] field set to _12_ (Gravity Related Depth).Note, that because every ZCOO value is explicitly linked to sounding datum there is no default value.

Remarks:

* The default sounding datum of the dataset must be encoded using the Meta feature **Sounding Datum**, and must be equivalent to the definition of the CRS as stored in the "Dataset Coordinate Reference System" record for the dataset.
* If an area of the dataset is referenced to a different sounding datum than the default, a separate *Sounding Datum* feature must be encoded. All parts of the dataset covered by *Quality of Bathymetric Data* features (see clause 3.8) must be covered by *Sounding Datum* features, with the attribute *vertical datum* indicating the sounding (depth) datum.
* The vertical CRS encoded in the Coordinate Reference System record fields for soundings is not utilized by the ECDIS in conveying the sounding datum information for an ENC to the Mariner in ECDIS. This information is provided instead using *Sounding Datum*. See also S-101 Product Specification Main document, clause 5.3.
* Sounding groups, depth contours and depth areas going across areas having different values of sounding datum must be split at the border of those areas. Other features that should be split include **Marine Farm/Culture**, *Obstruction* and **Wreck**, but only where the value of *value of sounding* is known; and **Berth**, **Cable Submarine**, **Deep Water Route Centreline**, **Deep Water Route Part**, **Dredged Area**, **Dry Dock**, **Fairway**, **Floating Dock**, **Gate**, **Pipeline Submarine/On Land**, **Recommended Route Centreline**, **Recommended Track**, **Swept Area**, *Two-Way Route Part* and **Quality of Bathymetric Data**, but only if the value of *depth range minimum value* and/or *depth range maximum value* is known.
* Meta features *Sounding Datum* and *Vertical Datum of Data*may overlap.

==== Vertical datum

Vertical (height) datum information is encoded using the Meta feature **Vertical Datum of Data**, or by populating the attribute *vertical datum* on individual geo features. The values encoded in the attributes **elevation**, **height**, **vertical clearance closed**, **vertical clearance fixed**, *vertical clearance open* and *vertical* **clearance safe** (positive values up) are referenced to the specified datum(s). *vertical datum* must not be encoded on any geo feature instance unless at least one of the above attributes is also encoded on that feature.

The vertical datum of the dataset must be encoded using the Meta feature *Vertical Datum of Data*:

All parts of the dataset containing data must be covered by *Vertical Datum of Data* features, with the attribute *vertical datum* indicating the vertical (height) datum. *Vertical Datum of Data* features must not overlap.Various height datums may be used within an ENC. For example, different datums may be used&nbsp;for the following:

* altitude of spot heights, height contours, landmarks,
* elevation of lights,
* vertical clearance.

Where different vertical datums are used for the various vertical measurements, the default value given in the metadata for the *Vertical Datum of Data* applies to the first group of the above list. The attribute *vertical datum* on an individual feature applies to the elevation of lights and vertical clearances and must only be populated if different from the value given by *Vertical Datum of Data*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used for tidal waters.
* Height contours, going across areas having different values of vertical datum, must be split at the border of these areas.
* Meta features *Vertical Datum of Data* and *Sounding Datum*may overlap.

==== Survey reliability and source of bathymetric data

The survey reliability and/or details of the source surveys used in compilation may be encoded using the Meta feature *Quality of Survey*.*Quality of Survey* can apply to bathymetry (for example, underwater rocks), non-bathymetry (for example, navigational aids) and a combination of these (for example, LIDAR survey).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* To express completeness of bathymetric data, the complex attribute *features detected* should be encoded. *features detected* indicates that a systematic method of exploring the seafloor was undertaken to detect significant features. The sub-attributes *size of features detected* and *least depth of detected features measured* must not be encoded unless the sub-attribute *significant features detected* is set to _True_.
* If it is required to encode a vertical uncertainty value, it must be encoded using the complex attribute *vertical uncertainty* on an instance of the information type *Spatial Quality* (see clause 24.5), associated to the relevant feature(s) point, multipoint and curve geometry, or an instance of the Meta feature *Quality of Bathymetric Data* (see clause 3.8).
* If the attribute *measurement distance maximum* is set to _0_ (zero) for the full area of the survey, the attribute *full seafloor coverage achieved* should be set to _yes_.
* Where populated, the value for the attribute *measurement distance minimum* must not be larger than the value populated for *measurement distance maximum*.
* *quality of horizontal measurement* on the *Quality of Survey*applies to bathymetric data situated within the area, while *quality of horizontal measurement* or *horizontal position uncertainty* on the associated spatial types qualifies the location of the *Quality of Survey*feature itself.
* The attributes *depth range maximum value* and *depth range minimum value* may be used to define the quality of individual surveys at varying depths in the water column, similar to the method used for indicating the overall quality of bathymetry using *Quality of Bathymetric Data* (see clause3.8).

==== Quality of sounding

If it is required to encode the quality of sounding, it must be done using the attribute *quality of vertical measurement* on either the *Quality of Survey*or on individual geo features (for example *Sounding*).The quality of sounding must not be encoded using *quality of vertical measurement* on the depth geo feature, unless it is different from the value of *quality of vertical measurement* encoded on *Quality of Survey* (see Table 11-1 at clause 11.3.1 and Table 13-1 at clause 13.3).

==== Update information

In S-100 ECDIS, the existing methodology in S-57/S-52 ECDIS used to provide, on request, a visual indication to the Mariner of information that has changed in the System Database when an ENC Update is applied will be implemented for this Edition of S-101. The following guidance, therefore, does not indicate any mandatory requirement for Data Producers or ECDIS Manufacturers in regard to IMO requirements for ECDIS performance.The Meta feature *Update Information* may be used by the ECDIS to provide information to the Mariner of changes that have been applied in an ENC New Edition; or to provide additional information to the Mariner other than the visual indication when an ENC Update is applied. *Update Information* must be associated, where encoded, with features that have changed using the associations *Updated Information* (see clause25.21) and *Update Aggregation* (see clause 25.20).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The mandatory attribute *update number* must be used, if required, to indicate the Update number of the Update dataset that the changed information is included in, as indicated in the file extension of the Update dataset.
* The mandatory attribute *update type* must be used, if required, to indicate the type of update applicable to the feature (insertion, deletion, modification, move). Where the *Update Information* is encoded to cover an area in which numerous changes have occurred (for example in a New Edition), *update type* should be populated with value _3_ (modify).
* The complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) should be used to provide a textual description of the changes to the associated feature(s) as included in the Update.
* The process of moving a segment of a curve or edge of a surface feature via an ENC Update requires the two-step application of the deletion of the segment at the original position and the insertion of the new segment in the new position. Where required, in order to indicate the move of a segment by ENC Update, three *Update Information* features should be created and associated, if required, as follows:

** An *Update Information* feature having *update type* = _2_ (delete) using the geometry of the deleted segment at the original position;
** An *Update Information* feature of type curve having *update type* = _1_ (insert) associated to the inserted segment at the new position;
** An *Update Information* feature having no geometry and *update type* = _4_ (move) associated to the above "delete" and "insert" *Update Information* features using the association *Update Aggregation* (see clause 25.20).
* The association *Update Aggregation* may also be used to group several related updates, for example changes to a routeing measure or aids to navigation range system. Where this is done, the *Update Information* forming the collection (container) end of the relationship should have no geometry and have *update type* = _3_ (modify).
* Where the changed information is related to an information type, the *Update Information* may be associated with the features to which the information type is associated.
* The attribute *source* may be used to indicate the related paper chart Notice to Mariner's number.
* At each New Edition of an ENC cell, *Update Information* features which are no longer relevant must be deleted; and for the next Update to an ENC cell *Update Information* features included in the previous Update dataset should be considered for deletion. Where a new Update impacts a feature that has previously been updated, any existing instance of *Update Information* associated to the feature must be deleted as part of the new Update; this must be done by deleting the existing *Update Information* from the dataset.
* The creation of *Update Information* Meta feature instances on request and the corresponding *Updated Information* and *Update Aggregation* association instances may be substantively automated in ENC production systems and associated databases, with automated population of the mandatory attributes *update number* and *update type* based on the change made to the data; and the complex attribute *fixed date range* and attribute *scale minimum* based on the attribution of the associated geo feature. The optional creation of these features and any additional information populated for *Update Information* is at the discretion of the Data Producer.

==== Magnetic variation (see S-4 – B-261; B-270 to B-273)

Of the various magnetic data, magnetic variation is the most important element for the Mariner. Until a world magnetic model is universally available for inclusion in ECDIS, if it is required to encode magnetic variation, it must be done using the feature *Magnetic Variation*. As a minimum, updates to the magnetic variation should be supplied to coincide with changes of epoch (that is, every five years).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* There remains a requirement to include magnetic variation information in ENCs whilst SOLAS regulations include the requirement for a magnetic compass and deviation card. User feedback indicates that it can be difficult to access magnetic variation information in ECDIS where it has been encoded using the point or curve primitive. In order to make magnetic variation information easily accessible to ECDIS users, it is recommended to encode this information as *Magnetic Variation* features of type surface. Encoding this information using the surface primitive ensures that the user can interrogate the ENC data using the ECDIS Pick Report function at any chart location to identify the value of magnetic variation at that location.
* The mandatory attribute *reference year for magnetic variation* must be used to populate the year value only (see clause2.4.8for format of date type attributes).
* Magnetic models are typically updated every five years (for example 2005, 2010… termed epochs). Magnetic variation can be calculated from computer models, or derived from charts produced by certain Hydrographic Offices or mapping authorities, which show the spatial distribution of magnetic variation values worldwide for the current epoch, by means of lines of equal magnetic variation (termed isogonals). The rate-of-change curves, which are over-printed on such charts, enable values for any point to be extrapolated for any time within the current epoch.
* Magnetic variation information in high latitudes (polar regions) is highly variable and unreliable, and as such is not normally used for navigation. It is therefore not considered to be a requirement to include magnetic variation information in ENCs covering polar waters.

[[sec_4.2.1]]
==== Local magnetic anomaly (see S-4 – B-274)

Local magnetic anomalies are local effects superimposed on the Earth's normal magnetic field which cause anomalous variation values. Permanent anomalies are caused by concentrations of ferromagnetic material in the Earth's crust or, to a more limited extent, by wrecks or man-made structures on the sea bed. They should not be charted unless they exceed 3° from the norm for the area (see clause 4.1), because diurnal and seasonal fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field can change the stated variation by up to 1° and, in some parts of the world, the data on which isogonals are based may not ensure the accuracy of charted values to better than ±2°.If it is required to encode an abnormality in magnetic variation for a localised area, it must be done using the feature *Local Magnetic Anomaly*.If the area cannot be defined, the feature should be represented as a point.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to indicate a local magnetic anomaly that is the same magnitude for both east and west, a single instance of the mandatory complex attribute *value of local magnetic anomaly* must be encoded, with the value of the anomaly populated in the mandatory sub-attribute *magnetic anomaly value* in decimal degrees. The sub-attribute *reference direction* must not be encoded in this case.
* If it is required to indicate a local magnetic anomaly that is in a single direction, a single instance of *value of local magnetic anomaly* must be encoded, with the value of the anomaly populated in *magnetic anomaly value* and the direction encoded using the sub-attribute *reference direction*.
* If it is required to indicate a local magnetic anomaly that is of a different magnitude for east and west, two instances of *value of local magnetic anomaly* must be encoded, with the values of the anomaly and the direction populated for each instance in *magnetic anomaly value* and *reference direction* respectively.
* If the value of the local magnetic anomaly is unknown, a single instance of *value of local magnetic anomaly* must be encoded, with *magnetic anomaly value* populated with an empty (null) value and the complex attribute *information* containing textual information relevant to the local magnetic variation.

== Geo Features – Natural Features

The use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as an integral component of ECDIS has raised questions as to the level of topographic detail that is required in ENCs to enable safe navigation using ECDIS. When determining the topographic information necessary for inclusion in ENC, all operational conditions of vessels must be taken into consideration, including the potential for corruption or failure of a vessel's GNSS reception. Such a failure would require the Mariner to navigate by fixing their position using traditional methods, necessitating a sufficient level of depiction of topographic detail in the ENC to facilitate navigation using these methods, appropriate to the Navigational Purpose of the ENC.

In addition, Mariners will continue to use visual or radar fixing as an independent method of confirming the position of their vessel as shown on the ECDIS, in order to gain a greater level of confidence in terms of their navigation.

Encoders are advised, therefore, that when determining the level of depiction of topographic detail required for ENC, this should be done in accordance with the following principles:

* The types of features charted and the distance inland to which they are shown will vary with the optimum display scale of the ENC data, type of terrain, availability of source data and, possibly, adequacy of regular navigational aids. The significance to the Mariner must be judged by the requirements of both visual and radar navigation.
* The navigator sees the coast in profile; the cartographer compiles it in plan and must always be aware that the navigator's interest in land detail is at its greatest at the coastline and falls off rapidly inland. On a low-lying coast, even minor clues to position near the coast, for example sand dunes, hillocks, low bluffs, may be very useful on most detailed ENC datasets. On steep coasts with deep water close inshore, sea traffic is likely to be concentrated off projecting points of land, and the nature of each headland must be made clear, whether it has vertical cliffs, or a sloping or low profile, for example.
* Off coasts inadequately marked by navigational aids, detailed topography in the coastal belt will allow the Mariner to clear dangers with the aid of improvised visual transits of charted topographical features.

No definite standards can be stated but the following principles should be observed:

* The density of topographic detail shown should be kept to a minimum consistent with providing navigators with all identifiable features and with a general picture of the relief as far as the probable skyline. This practice should enable landmarks to stand out from less important detail.
* Treatment of detail should vary with distance inland, for example inconspicuous features such as marshes and minor lakes and streams should be shown only when within about a mile of the coast.

Additional guidance regarding the level of depiction of topographic detail in regard to specific features is included in the following clauses.

[[sec_5.1]]
=== Cliffs (see S-4 – B-312.3)

A coast backed by rock or earth cliffs gives a good radar return and is useful for visual identification from a considerable distance off, where cliffs alternate with low lying coast along the shoreline. Where cliffs are prominent features they should be encoded on the larger optimum display scale for the ENC data; as an exception, where cliffs predominate over extensive stretches of coastline, it may be neither feasible nor particularly useful to insert a cliff throughout. Cliff top heights are useful for calculating or estimating distance off, (for clearing inshore dangers) and should be encoded where possible.

If it is required to encode a non-coastal cliff, it must be done using the feature *Sloping Ground* (see clause5.14) and/or using the feature *Slope Topline* (see clause 5.15), with attribute *category of slope* = _6_ (cliff). For example:

*Sloping Ground* may be used at large scale to indicate the horizontal extent of the cliff.

*Slope Topline* should be used on its own to encode cliffs at small scale, or in conjunction with *Sloping Ground* to indicate the crest of the cliff when it is considered useful to know its elevation, and/or to encode a cliff on land distant from the coastline.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* When the cliff is coincident with the coastline, a *Coastline* feature, with attribute *category of coastline* = _1_ (steep coast) should be encoded, and there should be no *Sloping Ground* or *Slope Topline* encoded.

[[sec_5.2]]
=== Cuttings and embankments (see S-4 – B-363.2 and B-364.1)

If it is required to encode cuttings and embankments, this must be done in the same way as cliffs; using *Sloping Ground* and/or *Slope Topline* features (see clauses5.14 and 5.15), with attribute *category of slope* = _1_ (cutting) or _2_ (embankment).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Cuttings and embankments should be encoded only when likely to be visible from seaward.

[[sec_5.3.1]]
==== Coastline (see S-4 – B-310 and B-311)

Natural sections of coastlines, lakeshores and riverbanks should be encoded as **Coastline**, whereas artificial sections of coastlines, lakeshores, riverbanks, canal banks and basin borders should be encoded as *Shoreline Construction* (see clause 8.6). The exception to this general rule is when a lake, river, canal, or basin is not navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, in which case the boundary of the lake, river, canal, or basin must not be encoded as *Coastline* or *Shoreline Construction* as the boundary of these specific areas (**Lake**, **River**, **Canal**, **Dock Area**, *Lock Basin*) create the portrayal of the bank or shoreline.*Coastline* and *Shoreline Construction* features form the border of the *Land Area* feature (see clause5.4).

[[sec_5.3.2]]
==== Natural coastline (see S-4 – B-312 and B-353.8)

Spatial types associated with coastlines considered to be inadequately surveyed at the optimum display scale for the ENC data (see S-4 – B-311) should be encoded using spatial attribute *quality of horizontal measurement*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_4_ (approximate).If it is required to encode a description of the nature of the coastline, it must be done using the attributes *category of coastline* and *nature of surface*. Other surface features may be used to describe the land region adjacent to the coastline (see clause 5.11).A steep coast may give a good radar return and is useful for visual identification from a considerable distance off, particularly where cliffs alternate with low lying coast along the shoreline.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* *Coastline* must only exist at the boundary of *Land Area*of type surface.
* *Coastline* and *Shoreline Construction* of type curve must not overlap. Similarly, *Coastline* should not share an edge with a *Shoreline Construction* of type surface (see clause8.6) having attribute *water level effect* undefined or populated with the values _2_ (always dry) or _1_ (partly submerged at high water), which is covered by *Land Area*.
* If the seaward edge of an encoded saltpan area is coincident with the coastline, it should be encoded using **Coastline**, with *category of coastline*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_2_ (flat coast).
* If the seaward edge of a marsh area or glacier is coincident with the coastline, the coastline should be encoded as **Coastline**, with attribute *category of coastline* = _8_ (marshy shore) or _9_ (glacier, seaward end). The coastline's spatial type should have the attribute *quality of horizontal measurement* = _4_ (approximate). If it is required to encode the area behind the coastline, this must be done using a *Land Region* feature (for marsh – see clause5.11.1.1) or an *Ice Area* feature (for glacier – see clause5.13).
* If it is required to encode mangroves in the intertidal area, this should be done using an *Obstruction* feature (see clause 13.6). However, on smaller optimum display scale ENC datasets where the mangroves are required to be encoded to indicate the seaward edge of a mangrove area only as the "apparent" coastline, this must be done using *Coastline* with *category of coastline* = _7_ (mangrove). The coastline's spatial type should have the attribute *quality of horizontal measurement* = _4_ (approximate).
* Where the source indicates the top of a cliff is coincident with the coastline at the optimum display scale of the ENC data, a *Coastline* feature, with *category of coastline* = _1_ (steep coast) should be encoded. In such cases, there should be no *Slope Topline* or *Sloping Ground* features encoded, in order to avoid clutter. If it is required to indicate that such a section of the coastline provides a good radar return, it must be done using attribute *radar conspicuous* on the *Coastline* feature. If it is required to encode a section of the coastline that is visually conspicuous, it must be done using attribute *visual prominence* on the *Coastline* feature.
* If the source indicates that the top of a coastal cliff is offset inshore from the coastline at the optimum display scale of the ENC data, a *Slope Topline* feature (see clause5.15) and/or a *Sloping Ground* feature (see clause5.14) may be encoded. In such cases, the *Coastline* feature should not have a value populated for *category of coastline*. If it is required to indicate that such a section of the coastline provides a good radar return, it must be done using attribute *radar conspicuous* on the *Slope Topline* and/or *Sloping Ground* feature. If it is required to encode a section of the coastline that is visually conspicuous, it must be done using attribute *visual prominence* on the *Slope Topline* and/or *Sloping Ground* feature.

==== Land area

Land areas that are never covered by the sea must be encoded using the feature *Land Area*. *Land Area* features of type surface are part of the Skin of the Earth.Rivers, canals, lakes, basins and docks, which are not navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, must be encoded on top of *Land Area* features (see clause 5.4).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to describe the natural scenery of the land, it must be done using the feature *Land Region* (see clause 5.11).
* *Land Area* is usually of type surface; it may, however, be of type point (for example islet, rock that does not cover), or of type curve (for example islet, offshore bar, isthmus).
* *Land Area* of type curve or point must not be encoded on top of *Land Area* of type surface, unless it is also covered by a **Lake**, **River**, **Dock Area**, *Lock Basin* or *Canal* feature of type surface.
* The limits of a *Land Area* of type surface must share the geometry of at least one of the following features:

** **Coastline**, **Shoreline Construction**, **Gate**, *Dam* of type curve;
** **Data Coverage**, **Dolphin**, **Gate**, **Dam**, **River**, **Tunnel**, **Dry Dock**, **Canal**, **Lake**, **Lock Basin**, **Dock Area**, *Land Area* of type surface;
** **Causeway**, **Shoreline Construction**, **Wreck**, **Obstruction**, *Pylon/Bridge Support* of type surface; and having attribute *water level effect* = _1_ (partly submerged at high water), _2_ (always dry) or _6_ (subject to inundation or flooding).

[[sec_5.4.2]]
==== Rocks which do not cover (islets) (see S-4 – B-421.1)

A surface feature must be encoded using:

* A *Land Area* feature of type surface (mandatory)
* *Coastline* or *Shoreline Construction* features of type curve (mandatory)
* *Land Elevation* features of type curve and/or point (optional)
A curve feature must be encoded using:

* A *Land Area* feature of type curve (mandatory)
* *Land Elevation* features of type point (optional)
A point feature must be encoded using:

* A *Land Area* feature of type point (mandatory)

* A *Land Elevation* feature of type point (optional)

==== Height contours, spot heights (see S-4 – B-351 and B-352.1-2)

It is assumed that Mariners will understand most methods of representation of relief with little difficulty. In general, it is assumed that Producing Authorities will choose the representation of relief most suitable to the terrain being charted and the navigational requirements. It is therefore left to national discretion to:

* omit all relief representation, except dykes and sea walls;
* omit all relief representation, except spot heights and cliffs;
* show relief by contours (and spot heights); or
* show relief by form lines (and spot heights).
Spot heights on ENC datasets should be confined to summits of hills, mountains and cliffs, particularly on datasets from which contours and form lines have been omitted; navigators will generally assume that heights selected for ENC are summits.If it is required to encode a height contour or spot height, it must be done using the feature *Land Elevation*.*Land Elevation* features must be covered by a *Land Area* feature of type surface; or a *Wreck* feature of type surface having attribute *water level effect* = _1_ (partially submerged at high water) or _2_ (always dry); or fall on a *Land Area* feature of type curve; or share the geometry of a *Land Area* of type point or a *Wreck* feature of type point having attribute *water level effect* = _1_ (partially submerged at high water) or _2_ (always dry). Spatial types associated with approximate contours or spot heights should be encoded using the attribute *quality of horizontal measurement*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_4_ (approximate).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Where it would not be worthwhile to contour ENC data of smaller optimum display scale, form lines (emphasizing a few 'remarkable' hills) and/or spot heights may be used to emphasize individual features.
* Contours should reflect the nature of the topography; that is, they should not be rounded or smoothed (by generalisation) when they should really be angular.
* The contour intervalmust be uniform for any dataset, or series of datasets of the same or similar optimum display scale, except that the lowest contour may be a supplementaryone, for example 25 metres where the basic interval is every 50 metres; or 10 metres where the basic interval is every 25 metres. Ideally the contour interval should be chosen so that not more than 10 contours are needed for the full range of height on a single dataset or particular series of datasets (for clarity and economy).
* If it is required to encode the elevation of an observation spot, benchmark or horizontal control station, it must be done using *Land Elevation*. If it is required to encode the elevation of a triangulation mark or boundary mark, it must be done using the feature *Landmark* (see clause 7.2).

==== Rivers (see S-4 – B-353)

Inland navigable waters must be compiled as fully as practicable, consistent with the optimum display scale of the ENC data. Other rivers should be compiled only in a limited way to assist in providing a general indication of the topography (except close to the coastline where they may be of direct significance to the Mariner).If it is required to encode a non-navigable river, stream or creek, it must be done using the feature *River*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If the river is navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, it must be encoded using the feature **Depth Area**, *Dredged Area* (see clause 11.4) or **Unsurveyed Area**, and the riverbanks must be encoded using the feature *Coastline* or *Shoreline Construction*. The river must not be encoded as a *River* feature in this case. If it is required to encode the name of the river, it must be done using a *Sea Area/Named Water Area* feature with attribute *category of sea area* = _53_ (river).
* Where the river is navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, special consideration should be given to encoding features specific to the river such as minimum depths within the navigable area; overhead clearances; distances along the river; and locks and lock gates (and any associated traffic signals).
* If it is required to encode a river that is not navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, it must be done using **River**, covered by a *Land Area* feature. The name of the river should be encoded using the complex attribute *feature name* on the *River* feature.
* Intermittent riversare those that are dry most of the time, and where required must be encoded as a *River* feature with attribute *status* = _5_ (periodic/intermittent).
* If it is required to encode an island in a non-navigable river encoded on **Land Area**, this must be done by encoding a "hole" in the *River* feature if the island is a surface at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, or encoding *Land Area* of type point if the island is a point at the optimum display scale for the ENC data. Encoders must not encode *Land Area*surfaces on top of *Land Area*surfaces. If it is required to encode an island in a non-navigable river encoded on **Unsurveyed Area**, this must be done by encoding a "hole" in both the *River* and *Unsurveyed Area* features and replacing with *Land Area* if the island is a surface at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, or encoding *Land Area* of type point if the island is a point at the optimum display scale for the ENC data. Encoders must not encode *Land Area*surfaces on top of *Unsurveyed Area*surfaces.
* Some dry riverbeds, known as wadi's, may be prominent topographic features. If it is required to encode a wadi, it should be done using a *Land Region* feature (see clause 5.11), with the name of the wadi encoded using the complex attribute *feature name*.

==== Lakes (see S-4 – B-353.6)

Inland navigable waters must be compiled as fully as practicable, consistent with the optimum display scale of the ENC data. Other lakes should be compiled only in a limited way to assist in providing a general indication of the topography (except close to the coastline where they may be of direct significance to the Mariner).If it is required to encode a non-navigable lake, it must be done using the feature *Lake*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If the lake is navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, it must be encoded using the feature **Depth Area**, *Dredged Area* (see clause 11.4) or **Unsurveyed Area**, and the lake shore must be encoded using the feature *Coastline* or *Shoreline Construction*. The lake must not be encoded as a *Lake* feature in this case. If it is required to encode the name of the lake, it must be done using a *Sea Area/Named Water Area* feature, with attribute *category of sea area* = _52_ (lake).
* If it is required to encode a lake that is not navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, it must be done using **Lake**, covered by a *Land Area* feature. The name of the lake should be encoded using the complex attribute *feature name* on the *Lake* feature.
* If it is required to encode an island in a non-navigable lake encoded on **Land Area**, this must be done by encoding a "hole" in the *Lake* feature if the island is a surface at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, or encoding *Land Area* of type point if the island is a point at the optimum display scale for the ENC data. Encoders must not encode *Land Area*surfaces on top of *Land Area*surfaces. If it is required to encode an island in a non-navigable lake encoded on **Unsurveyed Area**, this must be done by encoding a "hole" in both the *Lake* and *Unsurveyed Area* features and replacing with *Land Area* if the island is a surface at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, or encoding *Land Area* of type point if the island is a point at the optimum display scale for the ENC data. Encoders must not encode *Land Area*surfaces on top of *Unsurveyed Area*surfaces.
* Intermittent lakesare those that are dry most of the time, and where required must be encoded as a *Lake* feature with attribute *status* = _5_ (periodic/intermittent).

==== Natural sceneries (see S-4 – B-350)

If it is required to describe the natural scenery of the land, or to give the geographic name of an area on land, it should be encoded using the feature *Land Region*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* This feature has a use similar to that of the feature *Sea Area/Named Water Area* (see clause 9.1), but for the land.
* Sand dunes, hills and cliffs must be encoded, where required, using the feature classes *Sloping Ground* and/or *Slope Topline* (see clauses 5.14and 5.15).
* A *Land Region* surface should be bounded, if possible, by existing curves used by other features (for example*Coastline*). If necessary, however, this surface may be bounded by other curves created to close the surface, or to describe a new surface.
* For named capes, points, peninsulas and other types of *Land Region* where there is no specific value for the attribute **category of land region**, the generic term "Cape", "Point", "Peninsula", etc may be included on the complex attribute **feature name**, unless the name has been populated on an underlying **Land Area**, in which case *Land Region* should not be encoded.
* *Land Region* features of type surface may overlap.
* For additional guidance on encoding geographic names, see clause2.5.8.

===== Marsh (see S-4 – B-312.2)

If it is required to encode a marshy area behind the coastline, it must be done using a *Land Region* feature, with attribute *category of land region*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_2_ (marsh).If the seaward edge of a marsh area is coincident with the coastline, the coastline should be encoded as a *Coastline* feature, with attribute *category of coastline*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_8_ (marshy shore), and the coastline's spatial type should have the attribute *quality of horizontal measurement*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_4_ (approximate) for the visible coastline.

[[sec_5.11.1.2]]

[[sec_5.11.1.3]]
===== Lava flow (see S-4 – B-355)

If it is required to encode a lava flow, it must be done using a *Land Region* feature, with attribute *category of land region*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_14_ (lava flow).If the seaward edge of an encoded lava flow area is coincident with the coastline, this edge should also be encoded using a *Coastline* feature (see clause5.3), with attribute *nature of surface*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_11_ (lava). If the source indicates that the lava flow is active, the coastline's spatial type should have the attribute *quality of horizontal measurement*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_4_ (approximate).Distinction: Land Area; Sea Area/Named Water Area; Slope Topline; Sloping Ground; Vegetation.

==== Vegetation (see S-4 – B-352.4 and B-354)

In most areas the vegetation cover is of negligible importance on charts with the exception of:

* Areas where trees or marsh form the apparent coastline; see S-4 – B-312;
* Isolated trees or clumps of trees forming landmarks;
* Where, near the coast, wooded areas alternate with areas without tree cover and so may assist in identifying headlands or other stretches of coastline.
The following features should be omitted from even the largest optimum display scale ENC data:

* Grassland, cultivated fields (including paddy fields), bushes.
* Trees along roads, fences, ditches, and scattered trees (unless landmarks).
* Woodland cover within urban areas (unless adjacent to the coast).
* Woodland cover which is the general ground cover and therefore useless for identification of position.
If it is required to encode an isolated tree used as a landmark, it must be done using a *Vegetation* feature, with attribute *category of vegetation* = _13_ to _22_.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The attribute *height* is used to encode the approximate altitude of the highest point of the top of the vegetation. Where the source shows an island with the approximate height of the top of the vegetation above height datum (see INT1 - C14), a *Vegetation* feature should be encoded co-incident with the *Land Area* feature of the island, with attribute *height* corresponding to the value shown on the source.
* Where it is required to encode a mangrove area or tree located in the intertidal area, this should be done using the feature *Obstruction* (see clauses 13.6 and 13.6.1.1), with attribute *category of obstruction* = _23_ (mangrove). Where it is required to encode the generalised seaward edge only of a mangrove area to represent the "apparent" coastline, this must be done using the feature *Coastline* (see clause 5.3).

==== Built-up areas (see S-4 – B-370.3-4, B-370.6-7and B-370.9)

When representing built-up areas, the aim of the compiler must be to create the correct impression of the extent of the built-up area.If it is required to encode a built-up area, it must be done using the feature *Built-Up Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* A built-up area crossed by curve features (for example roads, streets, railways) should not be divided into multiple features, unless separate sections of the built-up area have at least one different attribute value.
* However, for presentation purposes, a built-up area of type surface crossed by a river or canal of type surface must be divided into several features, with the built-up area features not overlapping the river or canal feature. A built-up area of type surface should not overlap a lake, dock or lock basin feature of type surface.
* Several buildings or built-up areas may be referred to by the same settlement, village or town name on the source. In such cases, the individual buildings or built-up areas should be encoded as separate unnamed features, using the features *Building* or **Built-Up Area**, and additionally, an *Administration Area* feature (see clause 16.8) covering the whole named area should be created with the name encoded using the attribute *feature name*. The encoded *Administration Area* feature should also have the attribute *jurisdiction* = _3_ (national sub-division).
* *Built-Up Area* should be covered by *Land Area* features of type surface, or be coincident with *Land Area* features of type point.
* Where the source indicates that a built-up area extends into navigable water (over *Depth Area* or *Unsurveyed Area* object(s)), the *Built-Up Area* should be extended over the water area and the Boolean attribute *in the water* must be set to _True_ to indicate that the feature is to be included in the ECDIS Base Display. The actual coastline should be encoded as **coastline**, having no value populated for *category of coastline*. There is no requirement to split the *Built-Up Area* into two separate features where it crosses the coastline; or to encode the "apparent" coastline (seaward edge of the built-up[ area). Underlying bathymetry (depth contours, soundings) may be encoded as required. Exceptionally, encoders may extend the underlying *Land Area* and *Coastline* features seaward to the "apparent" coastline. This encoding should be considered for generalization purposes on smaller scale ENCs. Where the built-up area extends over navigable water it is not required to encode any supporting structures (for example piles, stilts).
* For encoding individual buildings over navigable water, see clause6.2.1.

==== Buildings (see S-4 – B-325; B-328.1; B-362.2; B-370.3; B-370.5; B-372 and B-373.1-4)

Waterfront, landmark and some public buildings should be encoded precisely and individually on the larger optimum display scale ENC data. When representing buildings generally, forming urban and suburban areas, villages, and other built-up areas, the aim of the compiler must be to create the correct impression of the extent of the built-up area and the density of the buildings.Within built-up areas,only waterfront, landmark, and certain public buildings of interest should be encoded individually.Scattered buildingsof no individual importance must be omitted when more than about 1 mile (or 2 kilometres) inland. Nearer the shore they may be generalised by encoding a few representative buildings, sufficient to give the correct impression of building density.Public buildings, with the possible exception of Post Offices and Hospitals, are charted mainly as visual features or points of reference ashore, not for their interest for particular functions. Except where they could be useful landmarks for navigation, they should be encoded only on largest optimum display scale ENC data.Buildings constructed as places of worship often form significant landmarks; their size and structure incorporating towers, spires, cupolas, etc often render them conspicuous. These buildings when known to be prominent or conspicuous should be encoded up to several miles inland, with sufficient information to enable them to be easily identified. When the optimum display scale for the ENC data permits, the building should be encoded as a surface feature with attention being drawn to any significant features (landmarks).If it is required to encode a building (other than a landmark, tank, silo or roofed structure erected or extending over navigable water), it must be done using the feature *Building*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For landmarks, see clause 7.2; for silos, tanks and water towers, see clause7.3. For common encoding combinations, see clause7.1. For roofed structures such as boathouses erected or extending over navigable water to provide protection for a vessel or its cargo, see clause 8.7.
* The feature association *Structure/Equipment* (see clause25.16) must only be used with *Building* features if the main purpose of the building is to act as an aid to navigation (for example a lighthouse).
* A ruined building should be encoded in the same way as the feature in good condition, but with attribute *condition*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_2_ (ruined).
* For an encoded *Building* feature located in navigable water, the Boolean attribute *in the water* must be set to _True_ to indicate that the feature is to be included in the ECDIS Base Display. Where such structures are located in the water it is not required to encode any supporting structures (for example piles, stilts).
* If it is required to encode vertical and/or horizontal clearances and any other information relevant for allowing vessels to enter or berth beneath/within the structure, this must be done by encoding the structure using the feature *Structure Over Navigable Water* (see clause 8.7).
* When a building is shown as a surface, indicating its true shape, and it is required to encode a prominent feature such as a tower or spire that is part of the structure, two features must be created (see Figure 6-1 below):

==== Airfields (see S-4 – B-366)

Airfields (or airports) within a few miles of the coast must be charted on larger and medium optimum display scale ENC data; they are significant to coastal navigation because of the many visual and audible features associated with them and the related air traffic.For ENC data at larger optimum display scales, an airport should be encoded using a combination of the following features: *Airport/Airfield* (surface), *Runway* (surface or curve), *Building* (surface or point) and *Landmark* (surface or point). At least one *Airport/Airfield* or *Runway* must be in this set of features.For ENC data at smaller optimum display scales, an airport should be encoded as an *Airport/Airfield* of type point.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If individual buildings are visually conspicuous, they must be encoded as separate features.
* If it is required to encode the control tower, it must be done using a *Landmark* feature, with attributes *function*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_39_ (control) and *category of landmark* = _17_ (tower). If it is required to encode other buildings, thismust be done using the feature *Building*.
* If it is required to encode a seaplane landing area, it must be done using the feature *Seaplane Landing Area* (see clause 16.5).
* For navigational aids associated with air navigation, and air obstruction lights, see clauses related to navigational aids.

==== Bridges (see S4 – B-381)

If it is required to encode a bridge, it should be done using the feature *Bridge*. Bridges may be encoded over water that is navigable or non-navigable at the optimum display scale of the ENC data. Where the bridge is encoded over navigable water, associated features such as spans, pylons and pontoons of the bridge must be associated with the *Bridge* feature using the association *Bridge Aggregation* (see clause25.4) (that is, the *Bridge* feature has geometry of type curve or surface, or has no geometry). Where the bridge is encoded over non-navigable water, then it must be encoded, where required, using a *Bridge* feature having no component features (that is, the *Bridge* feature has geometry of type curve or surface); or as a *Landmark* feature (see clause 7.2) if the bridge has geometry of type point.The value of the vertical clearance between (high) water level and any fixed overhead obstruction must always be given, where known, on the largest optimum display scale ENC data intended for navigation under the bridge, and for detailed passage planning. The datum above which clearances are given must be a high water level, preferably Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT), where the tide is appreciable. For bridges over navigable water, the value for the vertical clearance(s) must be encoded using the features *Span Fixed* or *Span Opening* (see clauses6.7and 6.8), with the clearance(s) populated using the complex attributes **vertical clearance fixed**, *vertical clearance closed* and/or **vertical clearance open**, and sub-attributes populated relevant to the span. In areas where the tidal range is not appreciable the datum above which clearances are given should be Mean Sea Level (MSL).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode the name of a bridge over navigable water, the *Bridge* should be encoded using geometry of type curve or surface, associated with all relevant components of the bridge using the association *Bridge Aggregation*. The extent of the geometry of the *Bridge* should utilise the geometry of all the components of the bridge so as to cover its full extent.
* If it is required to encode the extent of an unnamed bridge over navigable water, this may be done using a *Bridge* feature having no geometry, associated with all relevant components of the bridge using the association *Bridge Aggregation*.
* Water under a bridge must be encoded using the features **Depth Area**, *Dredged Area* or *Unsurveyed Area* (and appropriate *Depth Contour* and *Sounding* features) if the waterway is navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, or using the feature *Land Area* if the waterway is not navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data.
* When there is a fixed vertical clearance, closed vertical clearance, or open vertical clearance given for a bridge, it should be applied only to the portion of the bridge to which the clearance refers, using the features *Span Fixed* or *Span Opening* (see clauses6.7and 6.8). All encoded bridge spans must be associated with the *Bridge* feature using the association *Bridge Aggregation* (see clause25.4). See examples in the Figures below. If there are no vertical clearances given for a bridge and it is over water that is navigable at the optimum display scale of the ENC data, a single *Span Fixed* or *Span Opening* feature must be encoded covering the area of the bridge, having mandatory vertical clearance attributes populated with an empty (null) value.
* The attribute *height* is used, where required, to encode the height of the highest point on the bridge structure (see clause2.5.7).
* If it is required to encode a bridge for which part or the entire span is moved aside or backwards, it must be done using a *Bridge* feature, with attributes *opening bridge* = _True_ and *category of opening bridge* = _7_ (drawbridge).

==== Span fixed

If it is required to encode the clearance characteristics (vertical or horizontal) for any fixed part of a bridge between piers or supports, it must be done using the feature **Span Fixed**, which must be associated with the feature *Bridge* (see clause6.6) using the association *Bridge Aggregation* (see clause25.4). See clause6.6for examples of *Span Fixed* features aggregated to *Bridge*.The value of the vertical clearance between (high) water level and any fixed overhead obstruction must always be given, where known, on the largest optimum display scale ENC data intended for navigation under the overhead obstruction, and for detailed passage planning. The datum above which clearances are given must be a high water level, preferably Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT), where the tide is appreciable. Clearances must be populated using the complex attribute *vertical clearance fixed* and sub-attributes populated relevant to the feature, rounded down to the nearest whole metre (unless under 10m, when metres and decimetres may be quoted). In areas where the tidal range is not appreciable the datum above which clearances are given should be Mean Sea Level (MSL).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* *Span Fixed* features should only be encoded if the span is entirely or partly over navigable water at the optimum display scale for the ENC data.
* Where the optimum display scale of the ENC data is such that individual spans on a fixed bridge over navigable water cannot be indicated, the entire bridge should be covered by a single *Span Fixed* feature, having attributes populated according to the most navigationally important span.
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the reference datum for vertical clearances in tidal waters.
* Where encoded, an associated instance of the cartographic feature *Text Placement* (see clause 23.1) relates to the positioning of the vertical and/or horizontal clearances for the span, where encoded.

* If available and considered important for route planning and/or monitoring, the vertical uncertainty associated with encoded vertical clearance values should also be encoded.

==== Span opening

If it is required to encode the clearance characteristics (vertical or horizontal) for an opening part of a bridge between piers or supports, it must be done using the feature **Span Opening**, which must be associated with the feature *Bridge* (see clause6.6) using the association *Bridge Aggregation* (see clause25.4). See clause6.6for examples of *Span Opening* features used in conjunction with *Bridge* features.The value of the vertical clearance between (high) water level and any opening overhead obstruction must always be given, where known, on the largest optimum display scale ENC data intended for navigation under the overhead obstruction, and for detailed passage planning. The datum above which clearances are given must be a high water level, preferably Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT), where the tide is appreciable. Clearances must be populated using the complex attributes *vertical clearance closed* and *vertical clearance open* for the span and sub-attributes populated relevant to the feature, rounded down to the nearest whole metre (unless under 10m, when metres and decimetres may be quoted). In areas where the tidal range is not appreciable the datum above which clearances are given should be Mean Sea Level (MSL).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* *Span Opening* features should only be encoded if the span is entirely or partly over navigable water at the optimum display scale for the ENC data.
* Where the optimum display scale of the ENC data is such that individual spans over navigable water cannot be indicated, the entire bridge should be covered by a single *Span Opening* feature, having attributes populated according to the opening span.

* The complex attributes *vertical clearance closed* and *vertical clearance open* must be encoded for both the opening (vertical open) and closed (vertical closed) clearance values. Where the open vertical clearance is unlimited, the Boolean sub-attribute *vertical clearance unlimited* must be set to _True_.
* Where it is required to encode time schedule information relating to the opening and closing times for the span, including any scheduled closure times or amended schedules for festivals or national holidays, this should be done using an associated instance of the information types *Service Hours* (see clause 24.2) and/or *Non-Standard Working Day* (see clause 24.3).
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the reference datum for vertical clearances in tidal waters.
* Where encoded, an associated instance of the cartographic feature *Text Placement* (see clause 23.1) relates to the positioning of the vertical and/or horizontal clearances for the span, where encoded.

* If available and considered important for route planning and/or monitoring, the vertical uncertainty associated with encoded vertical clearance values should also be encoded.

If it is required to encode a conveyor, it must be done using the feature *Conveyor*.The value of the vertical clearance between (high) water level and any fixed overhead obstruction must always be given, where known, on the largest optimum display scale ENC data intended for navigation under the obstruction, and for detailed passage planning. The datum above which clearances are given must be a high water level, preferably Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT), where the tide is appreciable. The value for the vertical clearance must be encoded for conveyors located over navigable water using the complex attribute **vertical clearance fixed**, and sub-attributes populated relevant to the feature, rounded down to the nearest whole metre (unless under 10m, when metres and decimetres may be quoted). In areas where the tidal range is not appreciable the datum above which clearances are given should be Mean Sea Level (MSL).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode an overhead cable car, it must be done using a *Conveyor* feature, with attribute *category of conveyor* = _1_ (aerial cableway).
* In navigable water, conveyor supports must be encoded, where possible, using a *Pylon/Bridge Support* feature (see clause6.11), with attribute *category of pylon*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_3_ (aerial cableway pylon).
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the reference datum for vertical clearances in tidal waters.

* If available and considered important for route planning and/or monitoring, the vertical uncertainty associated with encoded vertical clearance values should also be encoded.

In areas where the tidal range is not appreciable the datum above which clearances are given should be Mean Sea Level (MSL).For power cables or transmission lines carrying very high voltages, an additional vertical clearance of from 2 to 5 metres may be needed to avoid an electrical discharge. When known, the authorised safe clearance (known as the safe vertical clearance), which is the physical clearance minus a safety margin, must be populated using **vertical clearance safe**, having the sub-attribute *vertical clearance value* populated with the safe clearance value.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode telepheric cables, this must be done using *Conveyor* features (see clause 6.8), with attribute CATCON = _1_ (aerial cableway).
* Where a cable has radar reflectors at known positions, they must be encoded as separate *Radar Reflector* features (see clause 20.18). If the whole cable is radar conspicuous, the optimum display scale for the ENC data is too small to show individual reflectors, or the positions of the radar reflectors are not known, the *Cable Overhead* should be encoded with attribute *radar conspicuous*.
* In navigable water, overhead cable supports must be encoded, where possible, using a *Pylon/Bridge Support* feature (see clause6.12), with attribute *category of pylon*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_1_ or _2_.
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the reference datum for vertical clearances in tidal waters.

==== Railways (see S-4 – B-328.4 and B-362)

In urbanized areas, depiction of railways within some miles of the coast is part of the ENC's function in giving a general indication of the degree of land development. In largely undeveloped areas, the depiction of railways to isolated ports draws attention to such ports and may be of some maritime interest for transport purposes. Railways should be encoded on larger and medium optimum display scale ENC data.Where railways run just inshore of the coast, or down to it, together with associated bridges, signal posts and other structure, they provide essential identification features. It should not generally be necessary to depict the smaller associated features - posts, gantries etc.If it is required to encode a railway, it must be done using the feature *Railway*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode a railway station, it must be done using a *Building* feature, with attribute *function* = _8_ (railway station). On the largest optimum display scale ENC data, the names of railway terminals or main stations may be populated using the attribute *feature name* for the *Building*.
* Abandoned railways (those which are mostly still intact) should be encoded, if required, as *Railway* with the attribute *status* = _4_ (not in use).

==== Roads and tracks (see S-4 – B-365)

On the largest optimum display scale continuous coastal series of ENCs, and larger optimum display scale ENC data, all roads and tracks running down to the coastline should be encoded where the optimum display scale permits. Particular attention must be given to local roads serving minor piers, boat hards and landings. Inland, major roads within a few miles of the coast should be encoded to give a general indication of the degree of development, but tracks and all or some of the minor roads should be omitted. In largely undeveloped areas, with very few roads, it may be desirable to encode even minor roads inland.On smaller optimum display scale ENC data, roads must be omitted.If it is required to encode a road or track, it must be done using the feature *Road*.

If it is required to encode a tunnel, it must be done using the feature *Tunnel*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If there is a waterway inside the tunnel, and the waterway is navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, it must be encoded as if it were a navigable canal (see clause 8.9.1), using the features *Depth Area* or *Dredged Area* in conjunction with the *Tunnel* feature. There must be no *Land Area* feature in the area covering the waterway.
* If it is required to encode a waterway inside a tunnel that is not navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, it must be done using the feature *Canal* (see clause 8.9) in conjunction with the *Tunnel* feature. A *Land Area* feature must cover the tunnel. The complex attributes *horizontal clearance**fixed* and *vertical clearance fixed* mustnot be encoded on the *Tunnel* feature in this case.
* If it is required to encode a tunnel that has no waterway inside it (but a railway, road etc), only the *Tunnel* feature must be encoded (the section of railway or road inside the tunnel must not be encoded), covered by **Land Area**, **Depth Area**, *Dredged Area* or *Unsurveyed Area* features as appropriate. The complex attributes *horizontal clearance**fixed* and *vertical clearance fixed* mustnot be encoded on the *Tunnel* feature in this case.
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the reference datum for vertical clearances in tidal waters.

* If available and considered important for route planning and/or monitoring, the vertical uncertainty associated with encoded vertical clearance values should also be encoded.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode an offshore landmark (as defined by the attribute *category of landmark*), the ECDIS system attribute *in the water* (see clause 30.2) must be populated to ensure the feature is always displayed on the ECDIS. Where fitted, lights should be encoded as described in Section 19, with the **Building**, **Wind Turbine**, *Landmark* or *Silo/Tank* being used as the structure feature for the relevant light equipment feature(s) (see clause 18.1).
* For encoding wind turbines, see clause 7.4.

==== Buildings, landmarks, tanks, silos (see S-4 – B-373; B-373.6; B-374.3-5; B-374.7; B-375.1-2; B-456.2; B-487.3)

Depending on height and the topographic relief, structures considered to be landmarks should be encoded up to several miles inland.Waterfront, landmark and some public buildings should be encoded precisely and individually on the larger optimum display scale ENC data. When representing buildings generally, including urban and other built-up areas, the aim of the compiler must be to create the correct impression of the extent of the built-up area and the density of the buildings.If it is required to encode a landmark (other than a tank, silo or roofed structure erected or extending over navigable water), it must be done using the feature *Landmark*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For buildings, see clause6.2; for silos, tanks and water towers, see clause7.3. For common encoding combinations, see clause7.1. For wind turbines, see clause7.4. For roofed structures such as boathouses erected or extending over navigable water to provide protection for a vessel or its cargo, see clause 8.7. For flare stacks on offshore platforms, see clause 14.1.1.
* The feature association *Structure/Equipment* (see clause 25.16) must only be used with *Landmark* features if the main purpose of the structure is to act as an aid to navigation (for example a lighthouse).
* A water tower must be encoded, where required, using the feature *Silo/Tank* (see clause7.3).
* A ruined landmark should be encoded in the same way as the feature in good condition, but with attribute *condition*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_2_ (ruined).
* Radio and television masts and towers are likely to be visible over long distances and should be encoded as landmarks, even when well inland. They will usually carry air obstruction lights.
* To aid identification of landmarks by the Mariner it may be useful to add the height of the top of the structure above ground level (*vertical length*) or above the general height datum (*height*).
* Buildings constructed as places of worship often form significant landmarks; their size and structure incorporating towers, spires, cupolas, etc often render them conspicuous. These buildings when known to be prominent or conspicuous should be encoded up to several miles inland (see Figure 7-1 below, examples (a) and (b)).
* The attribute *category of special purpose mark* should only be used if the *Landmark*is used as the front or rear lead for a transit, clearing line or measured distance, or for a leading line. Values for *category of special purpose mark* such as _16_ (leading mark), _17_ (measured distance mark) or _41_ (clearing mark) in particular should be used for these purposes.
* Values *category of landmark* = _26_ (bridge) and _27_ (dam) must only be used if the feature is encoded using point geometry; and must not be encoded over navigable water. Bridges and dams encoded using curve or surface geometry must be encoded using features *Bridge* (see clause 6.6) and *Dam* (see clause 8.12) respectively.
* For landmarks located in navigable water, the Boolean attribute *in the water* must be set to _True_ to indicate that the feature is to be included in the ECDIS Base Display. Where such structures are located in the water it is not required to encode any supporting structures (for example piles).
* When a building is shown as a surface, indicating its true shape, and it is required to encode a prominent feature such as a tower or spire that is part of the structure, two features must be created (see Figure 7-1 (b) below):
- a *Building* feature of type surface for the main building,image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_668be06e.gif[Shape21,624,183]
- a *Landmark* feature of type point for the prominent feature.__**Figure 7-1 – Landmarks**__

* Not all landmarks are visually conspicuous. If a feature is visually conspicuous (that is, it is distinctly and noticeably visible from seaward), the attribute *visual prominence* must be encoded (see S-4 – B-340).

==== Tanks, silos (see S-4 – B-340.2 and B-376)

Isolated tanks or gasholders may be good landmarks and should be represented true to scale (that is, as surface) where possible, to enable them to be used as fixing marks. Groups of tanks, as at a refinery, may be useful for general identification of position but cannot usually be used for precise position-fixing because of uncertainty of the location of individual tanks.If it is required to encode a tank or silo, it must be done using the feature *Silo/Tank*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For buildings, see clause6.2; for landmarks, see clause7.2. For common encoding combinations, see clause 7.1. For roofed structures such as boathouses erected or extending over navigable water to provide protection for a vessel or its cargo, see clause 8.7.
* Groups of silos or tanks (tank farm) in close proximity must be encoded, where required, using the feature *Production/Storage Area* (see clause7.6). Individual, visually conspicuous silos, or tanks within a tank farm, may be encoded as *Silo/Tank* within the *Production/Storage Area*. Multiple silos contained within a single structure may be indicated using the complex attribute *multiplicity of features*.
* For tanks or silos located in or over navigable water, the Boolean attribute *in the water* must be set to _True_ to indicate that the feature is to be included in the ECDIS Base Display. Where such structures are located in the water it is not required to encode any supporting structures (for example piles).

==== Wind turbines (see S-4 – B-374.6; B-445.8-9)

Wind turbinesare generally tall, multi-bladed structures, usually with two or three blades, which may pose as obstacles to navigation if located offshore but are often visible over long distances and therefore useful as visual references. Their purpose is to generate electricity for large communities, or to feed a national grid. They are often in groups (known as wind farms). Floating wind turbinesare held in position by ground tackle and consequently may be subject to significant lateral and some vertical movement.If it is required to encode a wind turbine, it must be done using the feature *Wind Turbine*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The attribute *elevation* is only applicable for wind turbines on land.
* To aid identification of wind turbines on land by the Mariner it may be useful to add the height of the top of the structure above ground level (*vertical length*) or above the general height datum (*height*).
* For offshore wind turbines, the Boolean attribute *in the water* must be set to _True_ to indicate that the feature is to be included in the ECDIS Base Display. Where such structures are located in the water it is not required to encode any supporting structures (for example piles).
* For offshore wind turbines (attribute *in the water* = _True_), the attribute *height* is only relevant for fixed turbines, and is referred to the vertical datum (see clause 2.5.7).
* For offshore wind turbines, the attribute *vertical length* is only relevant for floating wind turbines, and is referred to the sea level.
* A ruined wind turbine should be encoded in the same way as the feature in good condition, but with attribute *condition*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_4_ (wingless).
* If it is required to encode sites of dismantled offshore wind turbines, this must be done using *Foul Ground* features (see clause 13.7), unless the source indicates that any remaining structure protrudes far enough above the seabed so as to be an obstruction to surface navigation, in which case this must be encoded using an *Obstruction* feature (see clause13.6).
* If it is required to encode an offshore wind farm, it must be done using the feature *Offshore Production Area* (see clause 14.6). An onshore wind farm must be encoded, where required, using the feature *Production/Storage Area* (see clause7.6).
* Wind turbines may carry lights (see Section 19) or fog signals (see clause20.19). Where fitted, lights should be encoded as described in Section 19, with the *Wind Turbine* being used as the structure feature for the light equipment feature(s).
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the reference datum for vertical clearances in tidal waters.

* If available and considered important for route planning and/or monitoring, the vertical uncertainty associated with encoded vertical clearance values should also be encoded.

* For encoding offshore safety zones around offshore wind turbines, see clause14.1.3.

Some coastlines have prominent defensive structures, often disused, decayed, or used for non-defence purposes. Such structures range from major castles and forts to minor lookout posts and may be the main distinctive features of headlands or stretches of coastline. National regulations permitting, any such features as are likely to be visible from seaward and should be encoded on the largest optimum display scale ENC data.If it is required to encode a fortified structure, it must be done using the feature *Fortified Structure*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Where fitted, lights should be encoded as described in Section 19, with the *Fortified Structure* being used as the structure feature for the relevant light equipment feature(s) (see clause 18.1).
* For fortified structures located in navigable water, the Boolean attribute *in the water* must be set to _True_ to indicate that the feature is to be included in the ECDIS Base Display. Where such structures are located in the water it is not required to encode any supporting structures (for example piles).

==== Production and storage areas (see S-4 – B-328.2; B-367; B-374.6)

Production or storage areas located in close proximity to the coast are often prominent landmarks used by Mariners to assist in position-fixing. Features such as quarry faces, stockpiles, power stations, refineries, timber stacks in timber yards, factories, groups of tanks, groups of wind turbines, and slag heaps should be shown on the largest optimum display scale ENC data.If it is required to encode production or storage area, it must be done using the feature *Production/Storage Area*.

* If there are individual buildings or equipment features contained within this area, they should be encoded as separate features such as **Building****, Crane,** *Landmark*or *Silo/Tank* within the *Production/Storage Area* feature of type surface if the optimum display scale of the ENC data permits.

* If visible from seaward, a quarry face should be encoded as for a cliff (see clause 5.1), with attribute *category of slope* = _6_ (cliff).

[underline]#Distinction:# Free Port Area; Offshore Production Area.

[[sec_8]]
== Geo Features – Ports

[[sec_8.1]]
=== Works in progress and projected (see S-4 – B-329)

An ENC can seldom show the exact state of work under construction because it may not be known by the encoder and, even if known, may be expected to change between ENC updates (see Section 31). Where it is possible to provide the Mariner with an indication of the status of work under construction, under reclamation or planned, it must be done using the appropriate feature (for example**Shoreline Construction**, **Causeway**, **Dock Area**, **Dry Dock**, *Pipeline Submarine/On Land*), with the attribute *condition* populated as _1_ (under construction), _3_ (under reclamation) or _5_ (planned construction). Where the encoder wishes to provide such information to the Mariner and the details of the works are not known (nature and extent of the works), this should be done using the feature *Caution Area* (see clause 16.10), with known details of the works encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).

If it is required to provide the Mariner with an indication of the date to which information regarding the works is current, it must be done using the attribute *reported date* (see clause 27.154).

The coastline existing before the beginning of the works should remain encoded as a *Coastline* or *Shoreline Construction* feature until the completion of the works.

As the works progress and further information is supplied to the Producing Authority, ENC datasets should be updated appropriately through the issue of updates to the dataset or publication of New Editions of the dataset (see clause 31.2.3).

On completion of the works, full encoding of the new feature(s) in accordance with the relevant clauses in this document must be achieved, and incorporated in the relevant ENC dataset through the issue of an update to the dataset or publication of a New Edition of the dataset (see Section 31).

[[sec_8.1.1]]
==== Works on land (see S-4 – B-329.1)

Features likely to be prominent from seaward should be encoded as described above, where possible. New docks, locks, canals, etc, being excavated should be encoded similarly. The works must be covered by the feature *Land Area* (see clause 5.4) until completion of the works.

[[sec_8.1.2]]
==== Works at sea (see S-4 – B-329.2-5)

Works at sea which will extend the coastline seaward, where the line of the future coastline (including piers, etc) is known, must be encoded, where required, as described in clause 8.1 above, using the appropriate features. The existing coastline should remain until the works are completed and the new coastline has been established. The area of reclamation or construction must also be covered by the appropriate feature(s) from the Skin of the Earth. This may be *Depth Area* at commencement of the works, or if the works are planned and have not yet commenced; *Unsurveyed Area* while reclamation/construction is in progress but the area is still covered by water; or *Land Area* where the area of the works has been reclaimed (that is, is always dry).

Works at sea which will be wholly or partly submergedwhen completed, such as training walls or pipelines must be encoded, if required, using the appropriate feature relevant to the completed feature, in accordance with clause 8.1 above. The appropriately attributed depth information, if known, or **Unsurveyed Area**, must cover the works as appropriate.

Where the extent or nature of the works is unknown, they must be encoded, where required, using the feature *Caution Area* as described in clause 8.1 above.

Because lights and buoys marking the limits of works at sea may be moved without notice, they should be encoded only where it is considered safe to do so. Alternatively, this information may be included by encoding the complex attribute **information**, sub-attribute **text**, for instance, _Outer end marked by red lights_.

Natural sections of coastlines, lakeshores and riverbanks should be encoded as *Coastline* (see clause 5.3), whereas artificial sections of coastlines, lakeshores, riverbanks, canal banks and basin borders should be encoded as *Shoreline Construction*. The exception to this general rule is when a lake, river, canal, dock or basin is not navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, in which case the boundaries must not be encoded as *Coastline* or *Shoreline Construction*.These features form the border of the *Land Area* feature.

[[sec_8.6.2]]
==== Artificial coastline (see S-4 – B-313; B-320-322; B-324 and B-329)

If it is required to encode artificial sections of coastlines; or lakeshores, riverbanks, canal banks and basin borders that are navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, this must be done using the feature *Shoreline Construction*. The largest optimum display scale ENC data should make clear whether any shoreline construction along the coastline is intended for ships to berth alongside or not. In most instances, the associated detail (name or berth number, depths alongside, dolphins, cargo sheds, cranes or railway lines), in addition to the usually distinctive outline of such features as piers and jetties, will be sufficient to show that ships may come alongside. For shoreline constructions not intended to berth alongside (such as breakwaters and seawalls), an indication that ships do not go alongside may be given by encoding the sloping sides (for example the intertidal portion of the structure). If there is a possibility of misinterpretation by the Mariner, the danger may be indicated by encoding an *Obstruction* surface feature (see clause 13.6) with the seaward edge running parallel to the shoreline construction. Figure 8-1 below represents a shoreline construction such as a mole, including a berthing facility (INT1 - F12), with a relatively flat top (_abcdlmna_), and sloping sides partly above high water (_nmldefgn_) and partly intertidal (_dopqrhgfed_).__**Fimage::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_8ef71427.gif[Shape22,631,332]
 igure 8-1 – Shoreline constructions**__Remarks:

* Each of the three surface parts of the example shoreline construction above may be encoded as separate *Shoreline Construction* features of type surface; the masked curve (_ang_) must be encoded; and, if part of the *Shoreline Construction*boundary has a different characteristic (for example (_bc_) attribute *category of shoreline construction* = _6_ or _15_), it should be encoded as a separate *Shoreline Construction* feature of type curve. Alternatively, all the boundaries of the components of the shoreline construction may be encoded as *Shoreline Construction* features of type curve.
* In this example,the shoreline construction surface above the high water line must also be covered by a *Land Area* feature of type surface, and the intertidal shoreline construction surface must also be covered by a *Depth Area*feature of type surface with attribute *depth range minimum value* = -H (see clause11.7.3).
* *Shoreline Construction* features must be broken into their constituent parts where possible, and categorised using attributes such as *category of shoreline construction* and *water level effect* as indicated on the source.
* If the presence of a feature is only indicated on the source by a textual reference, without a clear symbol (for example 'pier', 'groyne', 'post'), it should be encoded using a *Caution Area*feature (see clause16.10) or an *Information Area* feature (see clause 16.11), with the textual reference encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6). *Caution Area* should be used if the information is considered essential for safe navigation.
* Intertidal or submerged artificial rock walls, such as training walls that are not attached to the shoreline, must be encoded, if required, as *Shoreline Construction* using the appropriate value for **category of shoreline construction**, and *water level effect* = _3_ (always under water/submerged) or *water level effect* = _4_ (covers and uncovers).

==== Structures over navigable water (see S4 – B-321.9 and B-370.9)

If it is required to encode a roofed structure that is over or partially extends over navigable water to provide protection for a vessel or its cargo, it must be done using the feature *Structure Over Navigable Water*.The value of the vertical clearance between (high) water level and any fixed overhead obstruction must always be given, where known, on the largest optimum display scale ENC data intended for navigation under the structure, and for detailed passage planning. The datum above which clearances are given must be a high water level, preferably Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT), where the tide is appreciable. For structures over navigable water, the value for the vertical clearance must be encoded using the complex attribute **vertical clearance fixed**, and sub-attributes populated relevant to the feature, rounded down to the nearest whole metre (unless under 10m, when metres and decimetres may be quoted). In areas where the tidal range is not appreciable the datum above which clearances are given should be Mean Sea Level (MSL).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode the minimum depth for a covered berth or the maximum permitted vessel draught allowed at the berth, this must be done by populating the attributes *minimum berth depth* and **maximum permitted draught**, respectively, for the associated *Berths* feature (see clause 8.14).
* Navigable water under the covering structure must be encoded using the features **Depth Area**, *Dredged Area* or *Unsurveyed Area* (and appropriate *Depth Contour* and *Sounding* features) if the waterway is navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, or using the features *Land Area* if the waterway is not navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data.
* The attribute *height* is used, where required, to encode the height of the highest point on the covering structure (see clause2.5.7).
* The complex attribute *feature name* must only be encoded, if required, where the name of the structure is different to the name of the associated berth.
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the reference datum for vertical clearances in tidal waters.
* In navigable water, roof supporting pylons/stanchions must be encoded, where possible, using a *Pylon/Bridge Support* feature (see clause 6.12), with the mandatory attribute *category of pylon*&nbsp;populated as empty (null). The *Pylon/Bridge Support* features must be associated to the *Structure Over Navigable Water* using the association *Roofed Structure Aggregation* (see clause 25.14).
* If possible, it is strongly recommended that an image or graphic of the structure is included, using the attribute *pictorial representation*.
* If available and considered important for route planning and/or monitoring, the vertical uncertainty associated with encoded vertical clearance values should also be encoded.

If it is required to encode a non-navigable canal, it must be done using the feature *Canal*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If the canal is navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, it must be encoded using the features *Depth Area* or *Dredged Area* (see clauses 11.7 and 11.4), and the canal banks must be encoded using the features *Coastline* or *Shoreline Construction*. The canal must not be encoded as a *Canal* feature. If it is required to encode the name of the canal, it must be done using a *Sea Area/Named Water Area* feature, with attribute *category of sea area* = _51_ (canal).
* Where the canal is navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, special consideration should be given to encoding features specific to the canal such as minimum depths within the navigable area; overhead clearances; distances along the canal; and locks and lock gates (and any associated traffic signals).
* If it is required to encode a canal that is not navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, it must be done using **Canal**, covered by a *Land Area* feature. The name of the canal should be encoded using the complex attribute *feature name* on the *Canal* feature.

==== Distance marks (see S-4 – B-307 and B-361.3)

Marks which indicate distances along a channel in nautical miles, kilometres or some other unit of measure are considered to be useful on the largest optimum display scale ENC data.If it is required to encode a distance mark, it must be done using the feature *Distance Mark*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The origin from which the distance has been measured is indicated using the sub-attribute *reference location*.
* Where an encoded distance mark has the mandatory Boolean type attribute *distance mark visible* populated as __True__, the *Distance Mark* may also be associated to the structure supporting the mark using a *Structure/Equipment* feature association (see clause 25.16).
* For encoding a measured distance between two transits of marks established on the shore, see clause 15.4.2.

==== Cranes (see S-4 – B-328.3)

If it is required to encode a crane, it must be done using the feature *Crane***.**Remarks:

* The purpose of charting these features is primarily to assist the Mariner in identifying particular berths, etc.
* The complex attribute *orientation* is used, where required, to encode the angular distance from true north to the axis of the crane's jib (generally perpendicular to the wharf).
* The position of a sheerleg or a travelling crane is defined as its resting position. If it is required to encode the track, it must be done using the feature *Railway* (see clause 6.14).
* Where fitted, lights should be encoded as described in Section 19, with the *Crane* being used as the structure feature for the relevant light equipment feature(s) (see clause 18.2).
* For cranes located in navigable water, the Boolean attribute *in the water* must be set to _True_ to indicate that the feature is to be included in the ECDIS Base Display. Where such structures are located in the water it is not required to encode any supporting structures (for example piles, stilts).
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the reference datum for vertical clearances in tidal waters.

* If available and considered important for route planning and/or monitoring, the vertical uncertainty associated with encoded vertical clearance values should also be encoded.

Numbered, named or lettered berth information must be encoded on at least the largest optimum display scale ENC data, in order to assist the Mariner in berthing activities within ports and harbours.If it is required to encode a berth, it must be done using the feature *Berth*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The berth encodes the named place where a vessel can be moored adjacent to a shoreline construction. The shoreline construction itself should be encoded using the feature *Shoreline Construction* (see clause 8.6).
* The attributes *horizontal clearance length* and *horizontal clearance width* are used to encode the regulatory length and width of the navigable part of the berth as declared by a competent authority, where known.
* The mandatory complex attribute *feature name* is used to encode the name or number of the berth. The attributes *minimum berth depth* and *maximum permitted draught* are used to encode the shoalest physical depth and maximum draught permitted at the berth respectively, where known.
* Terminal facilities (for example container, tanker, ferry) must be encoded, where required, using the feature *Harbour Facility* (see clause22.7).
* Landing places for boats should be encoded as small craft facilities (see clause 22.8).
* For encoding anchor berths, see clause 16.5.

==== Tidal and non-tidal basins (see S-4 – B-326.3-4)

If it is required to encode a non-navigable dock area, it must be done using the feature *Dock Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If the dock is navigable at the optimum display scale of the ENC data, it must be encoded using the features **Depth Area**, *Dredged Area* or *Unsurveyed Area* (see clause 11.7.4), and the geo features making up the dock limits must be encoded using appropriate features such as **Coastline**, *Shoreline Construction* or *Gate*. The dock must not be encoded as *Dock Area*. If it is required to encode the name of the dock, it must be done using the feature *Sea Area/Named Water Area*.
* If it is required to encode a dock which is not navigable at the optimum display scale of the ENC data, it must be done using the feature **Dock Area**, covered by a *Land Area* or *Unsurveyed Area* feature. The name of the dock should be encoded using the complex attribute *feature name* on the *Dock Area*. The boundary of a dock must not be encoded as a separate feature (for example*Coastline, Shoreline Construction*), except for the gate feature (*Gate*) for a wet dock, which may be encoded.
* The complex attribute *horizontal clearance fixed* is used to encode the size of the entrance to the dock area, where required.
* The attributes *horizontal clearance length* and *horizontal clearance width* are used to encode the regulatory length and width of the navigable part of the dock area as declared by a competent authority, where known.
* In a non-tidal basin (wet dock), depths may refer to a sounding datum different from that in open waters. If this area is navigable at the optimum display scale of the ENC data, the value of this datum must be encoded using the Meta feature **Sounding Datum**, with attribute *vertical datum* = _24_ (local datum), co-incident with the area covered by the dock.
* In reality, smaller named, non-navigable dock areas (at the optimum display scale of the ENC data) may be included in major navigable dock areas, with different names or characteristics. To encode this fact, sea areas (*Sea Area/Named Water Area*) may overlap a *Dock Area*.

==== Locks (see S-4 – B-326.6)

A lockis an enclosure at the entrance to a canal or non-tidal basin. Its ends are closed by lock gates.If it is required to encode a non-navigable lock basin, it must be done using the feature *Lock Basin*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If the lock is navigable at the optimum display scale of the ENC data, it must be encoded using the features *Depth Area* or *Dredged Area*(see clause 11.7.4), and the geo features making up the limits of the lock must be encoded using appropriate features such as **Coastline**, *Shoreline Construction* or *Gate*. The lock must not be encoded as *Lock Basin*. If it is required to encode the name of the lock, it must be done using the feature*Sea Area/Named Water Area*.
* It if is required to encode a lock that is not navigable at the optimum display scale of the ENC data, it must be done using **Lock Basin**, covered by a *Land Area* or *Unsurveyed Area* feature. The name of the lock should be encoded using the complex attribute *feature name* on the *Lock Basin* feature.
* The gates should be encoded as a *Gate* feature (see clause8.11) with attribute *category of gate* = _4_ (lock gate) or _3_ (caisson). For smaller optimum display scale ENC data, a lock may be encoded using *Gate* only, without using *Lock Basin*.

==== Tidal stream (flood/ebb) (see S-4 – B-407 and B-407.4)

The term "tidal streams" (French: "courants de marée", US usage: "tidal currents"), is used to designate the periodical horizontal movements of the water, which are astronomical in origin. These are distinguished from "currents" (French: "courants généraux"), which are not dependent on astronomical conditions. In practice the navigator experiences a combination of tidal stream and current. Tidal streams are defined by the direction towards which they flow. The terms "flood stream" and "ebb stream" are used for designating the horizontal movement of the water when the tide is respectively rising or falling. To avoid any ambiguity, in the case of streams which do not turn at about the time of local high or low water, an indication must be given of the direction towards which the stream flows.Where data are inadequate for tabulated information (*Tidal Stream Panel Data* – see clause10.5), or where otherwise required, single observations comprising flood and ebb directions and/or rates, preferably corresponding to maximum rates at the spring tide, should be encoded.If it is required to encode tidal stream information that is limited to flood and ebb directions and/or values, it must be done using the feature *Tidal Stream – Flood/Ebb*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Maximum directions and rates (velocities) of tidal streams during springs, where known, must be encoded in knots using the complex attributes *orientation* and **speed**, and should be quoted to one decimal place. In rivers and estuaries where there are permanent currents caused by the flow of river water, such currents must be included in the calculation of the rate. Where the speed of the current in a river or estuary is so variable as to make it impractical to indicate a value, *speed* (sub-attribute *speed maximum*) should be populated with an empty (null) value.

==== Current data (see S-4 – B-408)

The term "current(s)" in this document is used to describe water movements which are generally constant in direction, and are not dependent on astronomical conditions (that is, are non-gravitational). A current is described by the direction towards which it is running. For tidal streams, see clauses10.2and 10.5.Currents occur as:

* The flow of river water in rivers and estuaries;
* Permanent flows in other restricted waters, for example İstanbul Boğazı (Bosporus);
* Permanent or seasonal oceanic currents;
* Temporary wind-induced currents.
It is particularly important to depict currents (both the main flows and permanent eddies) which could set a vessel towards dangers.If it is required to encode a non-gravitational current, it must be done using the feature *Current – Non-Gravitational*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Maximum rates (velocities) of currents, where known, must be encoded in knots using the complex attributes *orientation* and **speed**, and should be quoted to one decimal place. Ideally, the minimum and maximum strengths should be quoted, where known, if the strength varies.
* In tidal waters where the flow of river water alternately reinforces the ebb tidal stream and reduces the flood, the combined effect must be encoded, where required, for the convenience of the navigator; that is, the combined current must be encoded using the features *Tidal Stream – Flood/Ebb* or *Tidal Stream Panel Data* (see clauses 10.2and 10.5). In restricted waters where tides are negligible, the direction and/or rate of flow should be encoded using *Current – Non-Gravitational*.
* Ocean currentsare permanent or seasonal, are somewhat variable in strength and direction, and generally cover broad areas. In cases where the current strength and direction are subject to seasonal variations, this should be indicated using the complex attribute *periodic date range*. This may require multiple *Current – Non-Gravitational* features with attributes populated in accordance with the seasonal variations to be coincident in the ENC. Where the direction of an ocean current is so variable that it is not practicable to show this information, the complex attribute *orientation* (*orientation value*) must be populated with an empty (null) value.
* Local weather conditions can produce significant temporary wind-induced currents which cannot be charted. If there is a known hazard, for example if winds from a particular direction have been found to endanger vessels by setting them on to shoals unexpectedly, a cautionary note may be added using the feature *Caution Area* (see clause 16.10). If considered necessary, the note may refer to further information in other publications, such as Sailing Directions.

==== Tidal stream panels (see S-4 – B-407 and B-407.2-3)

The term "tidal streams" (French: "courants de marée", US usage: "tidal currents"), is used to designate the periodical horizontal movements of the water, which are astronomical in origin. These are distinguished from "currents" (French: "courants généraux"), which are not dependent on astronomical conditions. In practice the navigator experiences a combination of tidal stream and current. Tidal streams are defined by the direction towards which they flow. The terms "flood stream" and "ebb stream" are used for designating the horizontal movement of the water when the tide is respectively rising or falling. To avoid any ambiguity, in the case of streams which do not turn at about the time of local high or low water, an indication must be given of the direction towards which the stream flows.If it is required to encode the information generally shown on paper charts as a tidal stream panel and stations, it must be done using the feature *Tidal Stream Panel Data*.Tidal stream values encoded in this way should be spring rates; that is, the tidal stream rates associated with a tidal range which is defined as the difference in height between MHWS and MLWS. Remarks:

* The mandatory complex attribute *tidal stream panel values* is structured such that, in combination with attributes *station name* and **station number**, the equivalent layout of a paper chart tidal stream panel can be reproduced in an ECDIS Pick Report display. An example of the encoding of a *Tidal Stream Panel Data* feature as compared to the S-57 object class *TS_PAD* is included below:

== Geo Features – Depths

[[sec_11.1]]
=== Generalisation of depth portrayal

When a survey or chart is reduced in scale the generalization that is required has several effects:

a. Deeper soundings tend to be eliminated while the shoaler ones are retained for safety. Sufficient numbers of deeper soundings should be retained to show the full range of depth. This is to assist the navigator who uses their echo sounder to help verify their position, or the Mariner choosing an anchorage of suitable depth.

b. Generalization proceeds by the inclusion of shoals lying to seaward of the principal contour, and by the smoothing of severely indented contours, with the effect of pushing the contours seaward. However, as a shoal which rises steeply from deep water is much more of a hazard than one which rises gradually, the encoder must ensure that the contours are not pushed seaward unduly. If the encoder gives the impression that a Mariner will get warning of too close an approach to the danger, by relying on their echo sounder to show gradually shoaling depth - when the danger is, in fact "steep-to" - they may seriously mislead and endanger the ENC user.

c. With the "expansion" of shoals, described above, it may become increasingly difficult to find space on an ENC dataset to show the line of deepest soundings through a channel, or even to show a channel at all. Yet even at small optimum display scales it is important to show the usable channels and indicate their least depth. The encoder may have to make greater use of depth contours than soundings in depicting narrow channels.

d. Even such dangers as drying rocks and islets require generalization in coastal areas. This is in recognition of the principle that, whereas they are particularly dangerous in isolation and must then be shown as precisely as possible, where they occur in groups a representative depiction is permissible, showing the outermost features as individually as space permits.

[[sec_11.2]]
=== Representation of depth: General

Some of the principles of depth depiction are summarized below:

a. The least depth over shoals and banks, and over sills (bars) in navigable channels, must be shown. Particular attention should also be paid to full and accurate representation of all other "critical" areas, for example on and adjacent to leading lines, controlling depths in fairways and along recommended tracks, in anchorages, alongside jetties, quays and berths and in the entrances to harbours and basins. Maximum as well as minimum depth should be shown where possible, for example to show the line of deepest water in narrow channels. However, deeper soundings on the sloping side of a bank near to the crest line should not be selected if they could give the impression that there is a deeper passage across the crest between shoaler soundings.

b. Soundings and contours must be used to complement each other in giving a reasonable representation of the seabed, including all significant breaks of slope.

c. The density of soundings should be determined by the type of seabed. Flat or evenly sloping areas, and banks of unconsolidated sediment, should have a minimum of soundings, fairly evenly spaced, but gradually becoming more widely spaced as the depth increases. Irregular seabed topography should be represented by a denser, and probably irregular, pattern of soundings. A steep gradient should be represented by close contours, undistorted by soundings.

d. In changeable areas, where surveys of different dates adjoin and do not match exactly, gaps in the contours may be left to indicate the discontinuity of depth to the navigator.

e. Where practicable, soundings on smaller optimum display scale ENCs should be selected from those shown on the larger optimum display scale ENCs.

f. In areas navigable only at high water, drying heights must be selected according to the same principles as soundings.

g. Where surveys are inadequate, it may be advisable to omit some of the standard contour lines.

==== Soundings (see S-4 – B-412 and B-413.1)

A sounding associated with a rock or coral pinnacle which is an obstruction to navigation must be encoded using the feature *Underwater/Awash Rock* (INT1 – K14, see clause13.4) with attribute *value of sounding* populated with the value of the sounding.The geometry of soundings and no bottom found depths (see clause 11.8) is held in a 3-dimensional array (latitude, longitude, depth). In the interests of efficiency, multiple soundings should be encoded in one spatial type (known as "grouping" of soundings), provided that all the spatial and geo feature attributes are common to the group and all soundings in the group are related to the same sounding datum (see clause 3.9).As the sounding multiplication factor (CMFZ) for ENC is 10, soundings may be encoded to one decimal place of a metre. Drying soundings must be indicated by a negative value.For soundings surrounded by a danger line, see clauses 13.1 and 13.2.Population of the attributes *quality of* **vertical** **measurement**, *reported date* and the spatial attribute *quality of horizontal measurement* are described in the Table below:

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Encoders are advised to use caution when considering encoding soundings that are shoaler than the range of depth of the surrounding depth area, as *Sounding* features will not be displayed when utilising some ECDIS display settings. Where it is considered that a sounding that is shoaler than the range of depth of the surrounding depth area may be a hazard to navigation, encoders should preferably conduct further investigation of source material in order to encode additional depth contour and depth area information more relevant to the sounding. Alternatively, encoders may consider using an alternate feature (for example*Obstruction*) to encode the depth.
* The attribute *technique of vertical measurement* must only be populated for *Sounding* features if it is different from the value of *technique of vertical measurement* encoded on an overlapping *Quality of Survey* feature (see clause 3.11); and the information is considered to be important to navigation.
* Where *Sounding* features are covered by the Meta feature **Quality of Survey**, the attribute *quality of vertical measurement* must not be populated unless different from the value of *quality of vertical measurement* populated for the *Quality of Survey*.
* An instance of the information type *Spatial Quality* (see clause 25.4) may be associated to the sounding geometry, using the association **Spatial Association**, to indicate, where required, that the horizontal position and/or the vertical uncertainty for the sounding(s) is of different (higher or lower) accuracy than indicated by the underlying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* Meta feature (see clause 3.8). See also clause3.8.1.3(Sounding uncertainty).
* Where a named isolated shoal is indicated in the dataset by a single encoded sounding, the name of the shoal must be encoded, where required, using the complex attribute *feature name* on the *Sounding* feature. Where the named isolated shoal is indicated by two or more soundings (and possibly other submerged features), the name of the shoal must be encoded, where required, using a *Sea Area/Named Water Area* feature (see clauses 2.5.8 and 9.1).
* Encoders must exercise caution when using the option to group soundings; particularly where they are included in an ENC Update as this may impact negatively on ECDIS performance regarding Mariner interrogation of Updates. When grouping soundings in an ENC dataset, creation of excessively large sounding groups should be avoided so as to reduce the impact when a sounding is to be removed by ENC Update; and new soundings to be added by ENC Update should not be added to already existing sounding groups.
* For depths indicated as no bottom found, see clause 11.8.

==== Dredged areas (see S-4 – B-414)

If it is required to encode dredged areas, this must be done using the feature *Dredged Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The attribute *depth range minimum value* must be used to encode the dredged depth for the dredged area. Where required, the attribute *depth range maximum depth* must be used to encode the deeper depth where a range of depths for the dredged area is indicated on the source.
* The boundary of a dredged area should not have coincident curve geo features encoded, unless part of the boundary corresponds to the shoreline (see clause 5.3.1).
* Dredged areas are often subject to siltation, resulting in shoaler depths being identified in the dredged area than the designed dredged depth. Where required,&nbsp;the shoal depths should be encoded using **Sounding**,&nbsp;with the appropriate underlying depth information (*Depth Area* and, if required, *Depth Contour*) to support the depths. Alternatively, the attribute *depth range maximum value* for the *Dredged Area* may be set to the designed dredged depth for the dredged area, and the attribute *depth range minimum value* set to the value of the shoalest depth, or a *Caution Area* feature may be encoded covering the shoaler depth area with the depth information provided using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6). Where the shoal depths are close to the edge of the dredged area, the dredged area limit may be adjusted to exclude the shoal depths from the surface. See also S-4 – B-414.5.
* The attribute *source date* may be used to encode the year of the latest control survey for dredged areas where the dredged depth is not maintained. For dredged areas where the dredged depth is maintained, it is not required to indicate the year of dredging.
* Where the complex attribute *vertical uncertainty* is populated for a *Dredged Area* feature, it must not be equivalent to or degrade the uncertainty indicated by the complex attribute *vertical uncertainty* for the underlying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* Meta feature (see clauses3.8 and 24.5).
* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.
* *Dredged Area* features are part of the Skin of the Earth.

==== Depth contours (see S-4 – B-404.2; B-410; B-411 to B-411.5; B-413 and B-413.1)

The standard series of depth contour linesto be encoded for ENC is: drying line (0 contour – where tides are appreciable), 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 2000 metres, etc. The 2, 5 and/or 15 metre contours may be omitted where they serve no useful purpose, and on smaller optimum display scale ENC data all depth contours to 30 metres (1:1500000 and 1:3000000 optimum display scales) or 200 metres (1:10000000 optimum display scale) should be omitted. It is not necessary for the complete sequence of contours to be shown, for example on steep slopes and around isolated pinnacles.Supplementary contours, for example at 3, 8, 25, 40, 75 metres and multiples of 10 or 100 metres may be shown, if the available data permit, to delineate particular bathymetric features where soundings would otherwise be the only depth information over a large area, or for the benefit of particular categories of shipping. The 2500 metre contour may be required for measuring Continental Shelf limits (see UNCLOS Article 76).Oimage::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_63fd866d.gif[Shape24,367,454]The boundary of a drying rocky area (see INT1&nbsp;‑&nbsp;J20) or coral reef (see INT1&nbsp;‑&nbsp;J22) may be coincident with the zero metre contour (see '_fg_' in the Figure). If it is required to encode this boundary, it must be done using the feature *Depth Contour* with the attribute *value of depth contour*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_0_.On the source, the presentation of contours in areas of steep slope is sometimes generalised so that closely spaced contours are removed to leave a single contour (see '_ab_' in Figure). In such cases, this contour must be encoded using the shallowest depth of the slope.Wherever possible, contours must be closed, or connected to the border of the dataset, a coastline feature or another contour, in order to define closed areas.Spatial quality associated with contours may be encoded using the *Spatial Quality* information type, attribute *quality of* **horizontal measurement**&nbsp;(see clause 28.14). This should only be encoded if the spatial quality of the contour(s) is different to that indicated for the overall quality of the bathymetric data in the area as described for the underlying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* Meta feature (see clause 3.8). However, in order to provide an additional indication to the mariner of areas of lower reliability bathymetric data, contours in depths of 30 metres or less may have the attribute *quality of* **horizontal measurement** on the associated *Spatial Quality* information type populated with value _4_ (approximate).n the larger optimum display scale ENC datasets, for example datasets intended for harbour navigation or berthing; or in areas where vessel under keel clearance is critical, a smaller contour interval may be used (for example 1 metre, or 0.1 metre if it is desired to provide the same depth accuracy as for soundings) in the depth range suitable for the deepest draught vessels that may navigate in the area. Such encoding is intended to best utilize the safety depth indication functionality of the ECDIS.__**Fimage::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_e4e67032.gif[Shape25,286,459]

==== Depth areas (see S-4 – B-410)

The sea area, the intertidal area and the navigable parts of rivers, lakes and canals must be divided into depth areas, each of them having a range of depth.As many depth areas as possible must be created using encoded depth contours.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The value of *depth range maximum value* for the deepest *Depth Area* on the ENC dataset should be encoded with the next deepest depth contour from the standard range of depth contours appropriate to the optimum display scale of the ENC data (see clause11.6.1), noting that the depth ranges used for adjoining ENC datasets of the same or similar optimum display scale must also be considered.
* *Depth Area* features are part of the Skin of the Earth.

[[sec_11.7.2]]
==== Geometry of depth areas

Where surfaces are not closed on the source, it may be necessary to close these surfaces using edges without associated curve features. This is mandatory at the boundary of a dataset (see Figure 11-3 below).In Figure 11-3 below, the annotation "**min**" equates to the attribute *depth range minimum value* and the annotation "**max**" equates to the attribute *depth range maximum value*.__**Fimage::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_7de2693a.gif[Shape26,545,204]
 igure 11-3 – Geometry of depth areas**__Remarks:

* For short isolated sections of *Depth Contour* features such as (_fi_), it is up to the producing authority whether to encode the small areas (_efije_ and _fghif_) as separate *Depth Area* features, or to encode only the curve (_fi_) as a floating *Depth Contour* feature within a single *Depth Area* (_abcda_) having attributes *depth range minimum value* = _5_ and *depth range maximum value* = _20_. NOTE: In Figure 11-3, if the optional *Depth Area* features are encoded, the depth area (_abcda_) will be split into two separate *Depth Area* features (_abgea_) and (_jhcdj_), both having *depth range minimum value* = _5_ and *depth range maximum value* = _20_.

[[sec_11.7.3]]
==== Use of attributes depth range minimum value and depth range maximum value for depth areas in general

For each depth area, *depth range minimum value* and *depth range maximum value* should be encoded with the values corresponding to the shallowest and deepest depths in that area. These values, except for the shallowest and deepest areas, should be chosen from the values of the depth contours encoded in the dataset, however the values for isolated shallow or deep areas may be taken from the shallowest or deepest measured depth (see items 2 and 3 in Figure 11-4 below).A drying area, within which a drying height is indicated without a true position, should be encoded using a *Depth Area* feature, with *depth range minimum value* set to the value of the drying height and *depth range maximum value* set to a dataset contour value (usually zero). Alternatively, *depth range minimum value* for the *Depth Area* may be set to –H (see NOTE (a) associated with Figure 11-4 below for definition of H), with the drying height encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6), sub-attribute *text*(for example_Dries 1.4_).If a depth area is adjacent to a non-navigable waterway, a closing curve (that is, no curve geo feature) should be encoded at the boundary between navigable and non-navigable waters. See clause 11.7.4.In Figure 11-4 below, the annotation "**min**" equates to the attribute *depth range minimum value* and the annotation "**max**" equates to the attribute *depth range maximum value*.__**Fimage::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_d5298855.gif[Shape27,454,442]
 igure 11-4 – Depth areas**__**NOTE (a)**: H = Height of the coastline datum above sounding datum, or a rounded value (for example (1) the value of the highest drying contour indicated on the source document; or (2) zero, if the coastline datum is the same as the sounding datum).In the following clauses, the paragraph numbers refer to the item numbers in Figure 11-4. These clauses do not cover all encoding scenarios.1. If the depth area is bounded by two or more depth contours:

* *depth range minimum value* should take the value of the dataset depth contour immediately shallower than the value of *depth range maximum value*.
* *depth range maximum value* should take the value of the deepest depth contour bounding the area.
2. If the depth area is only bounded by one depth contour andthe deepest depth is shown by a depth contour, and the shallowest depth is shown by a sounding (an isolated shoal area):

* *depth range minimum value* should take the value of the dataset depth contour immediately shallower than the value of the sounding or ‑H. However if the shallowest sounding within the area is considered to be the least depth of the shoal, *depth range minimum value* may be populated with the value of this sounding.
* *depth range maximum value* should take the value of the depth contour.
NOTE: In the case where the shallowest depth in the area is equal to the bounding depth contour, both *depth range minimum value* and *depth range maximum value* may be populated with the value of the depth contour.3. If the depth area is only bounded by one depth contour andthe deepest depth is shown by a sounding and the shallowest depth is shown by a depth contour (an isolated deep area):

* *depth range minimum value* should take the value of the depth contour.
* *depth range maximum value* should take the value of the dataset depth contour immediately deeper than or equal to the value of the sounding. However if the deepest sounding within the area is considered to be the deepest depth of the deep, *depth range maximum value* may be populated with the value of this sounding.
4. If the shallowest depth is defined by the coastline:

* *depth range minimum value*&nbsp;should take the value of&nbsp;-H.
* *depth range maximum value* should take the value of the shallowest dataset depth contour bounding the area.
5. If the depth area is bounded by only one depth contour, contains no soundings, and is a shoal:

* *depth range minimum value* should take the value of the dataset depth contour immediately shallower than the value of the depth contour, or -H.
* *depth range maximum value* should take the value of the depth contour.
6. If the depth area is bounded by only one depth contour, contains no soundings, and is a deep:

* *depth range minimum value* should take the value of the depth contour.
* *depth range maximum value* should take the value of the standard depth contour immediately deeper than the value of the depth contour.
7. If the depth area is bounded by an incomplete depth contour on one side (such as in incompletely surveyed area), and a complete depth contour on the other:

* These areas are optional. See clause 11.7.2 above and associated Figure 11-3.
8. If the depth area is bounded by complete depth contours, but contains an incomplete (floating) depth contour:

* *depth range minimum value*&nbsp;should take the value of the shallowest depth contour.
* *depth range maximum value* should take the value of the deepest depth contour.
NOTE: Where the optional depth areas in paragraph 7 above are encoded, this will result in two discrete *Depth Area* features, one on each side of the encoded optional depth areas. See clause 11.7.2 above and associated Figure 11-3.

[[sec_11.7.4]]

Where these areas are navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, they must be encoded using the Skin of the Earth features **Depth Area**, *Dredged Area* or **Unsurveyed Area**, and coastline-type features *Coastline* or *Shoreline Construction*. If it is required to encode the nature and name of the area, it must be done using the feature *Sea Area/Named Water Area*.Where these areas are required and are not navigable at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, they must be encoded using the features **River**, *Canal* or *Lake*. These features must be covered by *Land Area*features.

==== Areas of continual change (see S-4 – B-416)

If it is required to encode an area of continually changing bathymetry, it must be done by populating the attribute *category of temporal variation* = _2_ (likely to change and significant shoaling expected) or _3_ (likely to change but significant shoaling not expected) for the underlying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature (see clause 3.8).Such areas must always overlap *Depth Area* features.An area on the source with the indication "Less water" should be encoded using the feature *Caution Area* (see clause 16.10). Caution notes in such areas must be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).If it is required to encode sandwaves, this must be done using the feature *Sandwave* (see clause 12.4).Distinction: Depth Contour; Dredged Area; Obstruction; Sea Area/Named Water Area; Sounding; Unsurveyed Area; Wreck.

==== No bottom found depths (see S-4 – B-412.3)

If it is required to encode a depth at a point at which it is indicated as having no bottom found at the value shown, it must be done using the feature *Depth – No Bottom Found*.The geometry of soundings (see clause11.3.1) and no bottom found depths is held in a 3-dimensional array (latitude, longitude, depth). In the interests of efficiency, multiple no bottom found depths should be encoded in one spatial type, provided that all the spatial and geo feature attributes are common to the group and all no bottom found depths in the group are related to the same sounding datum (see clause 3.9).Even though the sounding multiplication factor (CMFZ) for ENC is {10}, no bottom found depths must be encoded to a whole metre value.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For encoding areas that have been systematically surveyed and for which the depth has not been found (for example, for LIDAR surveys), see clause11.5.1.

[underline]#Distinction:# Depth Area; Sounding; Swept Area.

[[sec_11.9]]
=== Areas with inadequate depth information

[[sec_11.9.1]]
==== Inadequately surveyed areas (see S-4 – B-417)

Inadequately surveyed areasmay be defined as those areas where bathymetry is based on older lead line surveys or other surveys which are either open in nature (for example reconnaissance surveys), or are not hydrographic surveys (for example seismic surveys). These types of surveys are inadequate for identifying all shoals that may exist between lines of soundings, or may not be "shoal-biased" in their selection of recorded depths.

An inadequately surveyed area should be encoded using either an *Unsurveyed Area* feature, within which soundings and contours may be encoded (but not depth areas), or using *Depth Area* features. The attributes *depth range minimum value* and *depth range maximum value* for such depth areas should have explicit values.

The area must also be covered by *Quality of Bathymetric Data* features (see clause 3.8), having appropriate attribute values, usually *category of temporal variation* = _6_ (unassessed), *features detected* (*significant features detected*) = __False__, and *full seafloor coverage achieved* = _False_. Further information may be given using the Meta feature *Quality of Survey* (see clause3.11), where appropriate.

A cautionary note should also be encoded using a *Caution Area* feature of type surface (see clause 16.11), complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).

[[sec_11.9.2]]
==== Bathymetry in areas of minimal depiction of detail on paper charts

Where areas of little or no depth information exist within a specified ENC usage, they should be encoded using one of the following options:

[[sec_11.9.2.1]]
===== Areas of omitted bathymetry

Encoders are advised that when encoding areas of bathymetry from paper charts containing minimal depth detail at scales that correspond to the optimum display scale for the data, to consult larger scale paper charts or optimum display scale ENC datasets and generalise the bathymetry from this data. This is done to ensure that sufficient information is encoded so as not to conflict with larger optimum display scale coverage. The following is the recommended minimum encoding requirement in such cases:

Where larger optimum display scale ENC coverage is available, the larger scale datasets should be examined to determine the shallowest *Depth Area* feature, other than the intertidal area, within the whole of the area. Intertidal areas should then be generalised from the larger optimum display scale coverage, and one *Depth Area* feature may then be created, with attributes *depth range minimum value* and *depth range maximum value* encoded from the values obtained from the larger scale, corresponding to the remaining area of bathymetry.

Where larger optimum display scale coverage does not exist, a single *Depth Area* feature may be created to cover the area of omitted bathymetry. The *depth range minimum value* of the *Depth Area* feature should be set to the shallowest value appropriate to the colour tint that is applied to it (for example if blue tint is used for 5-20m areas, the *depth range minimum value* for the area of omitted bathymetry should be set to _5_). The *depth range maximum value* should be set to the shallowest value of the surrounding Skin of the Earth polygons.

In either case, the areas should be covered by a *Caution Area* feature, the boundary of which follows exactly the surrounding Skin of the Earth features (see clause2.5.3.2).

Encoders should consider the effect of over-generalising areas of omitted bathymetry on the ECDIS display as the Mariner "zooms out" through the ENC display scales.

[[sec_11.9.2.2]]
===== Areas of very simplified bathymetry

In these areas, information relating to bathymetry (for example depth contours, dangers, rocky areas, isolated rocks, nature of the seabed, dredged areas, unsurveyed areas) should be individually encoded as normal.

A *Caution Area* feature (see clause16.11) should be created covering the *Depth Area* features within the area of simplified bathymetry, with a cautionary note encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).

[[sec_11.9.3]]
==== Depth discontinuities between surveys (see S-4 – B-416.1)

Depth discontinuities between adjoining or overlapping source bathymetric surveys may be caused by:

* Surveys in areas of continually changing depth (see clause 11.7.5) conducted with a significant time gap between the surveys; or
* Adjoining areas having significant differences in the quality of bathymetric data (see clause 3.8).

It may not be possible to safely resolve significant depth discontinuity by interpolating approximate depth contours, which may compromise the ability for the compiler to adequately encode complete, non-overlapping Skin of the Earth coverage of the area of the ENC cell covered by data. Where it is required to indicate these significant depth discontinuities, it should be done by encoding a "very narrow" *Unsurveyed Area* feature.

The "very narrow area" should be at least 0.3mm in width at optimum display scale for the ENC data.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* An indication of the purpose of the *Unsurveyed Area* may be done by population of the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6), sub-attribute **text**, for example _Discontinuity between surveys_.
* In order to provide an indication to the Mariner of the more reliable encoded bathymetry in an area of continually changing depth, the defining attributes should be downgraded for the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature (see clause 3.8) corresponding to the less reliable (or older) data.

[[sec_11.9.4]]
==== Satellite imagery as source information

In some areas source information may be limited to shallow water depth information derived from satellite imagery. Where defined depths can be interpolated from satellite imagery (for example the drying line, 5 metre or 10 metre depth contours), and little or no reliable source survey information exists in the area, consideration should be given to showing this information in ENCs.

If it is required to encode shoal areas which have been derived from satellite imagery, *Depth Area* and *Depth Contour* features of an appropriate depth range should be used. This should only be done in areas which have not been systematically surveyed. Areas of depth information derived from satellite imagery must be covered by *Quality of Bathymetric Data* Meta features (see clause3.8). Recommended attribute values for the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* include *category of temporal variation* = _6_ (unassessed); *features detected* (*significant features detected*) = __False__; and *full seafloor coverage achieved* = _False_. Optionally, the area may also be covered by a *Quality of Survey* feature (see clause3.11), having attribute *technique of vertical measurement* = _11_ (satellite imagery).

In some cases satellite imagery provides evidence that existing charted information derived from source survey data has changed over time. If required, the attribute *category of temporal variation* on the underlying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* Meta feature should be amended to _2_ (likely to change and significant shoaling expected) or _3_ (likely to change but significant shoaling not expected). Alternatively, if the quality of the charted bathymetry is considered by the Producing Authority to be poor, consideration may be given to replacing the existing charted detail using the satellite derived data, as described above, however with *category of temporal variation* = _2_ (likely to change and significant shoaling expected) or _3_ (likely to change but significant shoaling not expected).

==== Description of the seabed (see S-4 – B-425 to B-427)

The nature (quality) of the seabed (bottom) must be shown in sufficient detail, where known and on the appropriate optimum display scale ENC data, for such purposes as:

* to give some guidance on holding characteristics when anchoring;
* to help in assessing the stability of shoals and to distinguish rocks from unconsolidated material, when navigating in shoal areas;
* to show where vessels may safely take the ground at low water in tidal areas; or
* to give an indication of the nature of the seabed in deeper waters for fishermen and submariners.
If it is required to encode an area of the sea where the nature of the seabed is homogeneous, it must be done using the feature *Seabed Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Generally, it is not possible to define a seabed area by its real extent, due to seabed samples usually being obtained at discrete locations. For that reason, the characteristics of the seabed area may be represented at one single position.
* Where the seabed comprises a mixture of material, *surface characteristics* must be populated as multiple iterations, with the main constituent given first.
* Where the seabed comprises layered material that is of relevance to navigation or anchoring, *surface characteristics* must be populated as multiple iterations, with the surface constituent given first, with a value for the attribute *underlying layer* of _0_. Successive layers below the surface must have *underlying layer* set to __1__, __2__, … .
image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_9b408a50.gif[Shape28,612,436]__**Figure 12-1 – Seabed areas**__

* In the following clauses, the paragraph prefixes refer to the examples shown in Figure 12-1.
(a) Mixed natures: The dominant nature of the seabed (*nature of surface*) should be populated first, along with its associated qualifying term (*nature of surface – qualifying terms*), if required, using the complex attribute *surface characteristics*. Other natures should then be populated, in order of dominance, using further ordered instances of **surface characteristics**__,__(b) Underlying material: Should be encoded in the same way as mixed natures, and populating the sub-attribute *underlying layer* with the appropriate level of the layer below the surface layer. The surface layer must be encoded first, followed by the underlying layers.(c) Coral reef, which is always covered, represented as a surface (INT1 – K16): An *Obstruction* feature of type surface must be encoded with attributes *category of obstruction*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_6_ (foul area), *nature of surface*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_14_ (coral) and *water level effect* = _3_ (always underwater/submerged). This feature must be covered by a *Depth Area* or *Unsurveyed Area* feature as appropriate. In this area, some point dangers may be shown. An *Underwater/Awash Rock* feature should be encoded for each individual point danger, with *nature of surface*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_14_ (coral).(d) Hard bottom: The attribute *nature of surface – qualifying terms*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_10_ (hard) should be encoded, with the associated *nature of surface* populated with an empty (null) value.(e) On the source, in the intertidal area or along the drying line, the nature of surface is sometimes shown by an open line rather than a closed area. In such cases, a *Seabed Area* feature of type curve should be encoded, with attribute *water level effect* = _4_ (covers and uncovers).(f) If it is required to encode a rock pinnacle which is dangerous to navigation, it must be done using the feature **Underwater/Awash Rock**, while a rocky nature of seabed should be encoded using a *Seabed Area* feature.(g) Where a *Seabed Area* feature of type surface is located in an intertidal area, it should be encoded with *water level effect* = _4_ (covers and uncovers), in order for the intertidal rock or coral symbol to be displayed in ECDIS.

* The nature of the seabed should be shown in depths of 2000m and less. The nature of the seabed may be shown in greater depths if thought to be useful.
Table 12-1 below contains the most common encoding combinations of *nature of surface* and **nature of surface – qualifying terms**; other coding combinations are possible.

==== Sandwaves (see S-4 – B-428.1)

Sandwave areas may be dangerous to Mariners, as the depth may be less than charted, because surveys are not necessarily conducted at the ideal time for sandwave building. Some research has shown that sandwave mobility is most evident in the vertical plane and high spots may occur on crest lines in response to calm weather, and possibly during particular times within the tidal cycle. It is therefore important to warn the Mariner of the presence of sandwaves, and provide them with as much information as is available and can be included in the ENC.If it is required to encode sandwaves, this must be done using the feature *Sandwave*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The shifting nature of the seabed resulting from sandwave activity should be indicated on the underlying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* (see clause3.8), using the attribute *category of temporal variation*.
* The attribute *vertical length* is used to populate the amplitude of the sandwave above the seafloor, where known.
* Care must be taken not to over-generalize depth depiction in sandwave areas, as the typically convoluted contour pattern, and significant depth changes between soundings selected from crests and troughs, help to draw attention to these features. However, this will not usually be sufficient warning, as the variance between crest and trough may fall between standard contours, or the optimum display scale for the ENC data may be insufficient to show the sandwaves individually, or anything but the shoalest soundings. Attention should therefore be drawn to the area by encoding a *Sandwave* feature. If considered necessary, the nature of any navigational hazard presented by the sandwaves may be incorporated using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).
* Where frequently repeated surveys show variations in least depth, the shoalest soundings obtained over a period of years should be encoded. This blending of details from surveys of differing dates must be done with care; in particular, long-term deepening must not be overlooked.

[[sec_13]]
== Geo Features – Rocks, Wrecks, Foul Ground, Obstructions

Full details of all dangers to navigation must be encoded except in those areas for which the ENC is clearly inappropriate for navigation. The fullest possible information on clearance depths must be given irrespective of their depths, in preference to making any arbitrary distinction between "dangerous" and "non-dangerous" depths. This will allow navigators of all classes of vessels, including deep-draught ships and submarines, to make their own assessments of what is dangerous to them.

Due to possible ECDIS display issues isolated dangers of type point (feature types **Underwater Rock**, *Wreck* and *Obstruction*) should be encoded as isolated nodes; that is, they should not be encoded on connected nodes. Similarly, isolated dangers should not be encoded on an edge of a **Depth Area**, *Dredged Area* or **Unsurveyed Area**; where this occurs the geometry of the Skin of the Earth features should be amended.

[[sec_13.1]]

The area enclosed by the danger line must be encoded using *Wreck* (see clause 13.5) or *Obstruction* (see clause 13.6) features of type surface, with the attribute values, when encoded, reflecting the characteristics of the shallowest point feature encoded in the area. The area must also be covered by *Depth Area* or *Unsurveyed Area* features as appropriate.

If it is required to encode one or more least depths in such an area, it must be done using a point feature for each of the depths, in addition to the surface feature.

__**Table 13-2 – Underwater rocks – Attribute encoding**__Remarks:

* For rocks which do not cover (islets), see clause5.4.2.
* All *Underwater/Awash Rock* features should be encoded using one of the above combinations of attributes.
* The minimum depth, if known, over any submerged rock, must be encoded using the attribute *value of sounding*. Where *value of sounding* is populated with an empty (null) value, display of the rock in ECDIS as an underwater hazard, in accordance with the Mariner's selected safety depth, will be dependent on the value populated for the ECDIS "system" attribute *default clearance depth* (see clauses 2.4.5.1, 30.1 and 8^th^ bullet below).
* An instance of the information type *Spatial Quality* (see clause 25.4) may be associated to the rock point geometry, using the association **Spatial Association**, to indicate, where required, that the horizontal position and/or the vertical uncertainty for the rock is of different (higher or lower) accuracy than indicated by the underlaying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* Meta feature (see clause 3.8). Where *Spatial Quality* is associated to the rock and*value of sounding* is populated with an empty (null) value, the value for the attribute *vertical uncertainty* (*uncertainty fixed*) on the associated **Spatial Quality**, where required, must also be populated as empty (null). See also clause3.8.1.3(Sounding uncertainty).
* Where *Underwater/Awash Rock* is encoded, there must be no *Sounding* feature encoded coincident.
* For area rock and coral reef features, see clause 12.1.1.
* When a group of rocks is surrounded by a danger line, each rock should be encoded as a separate*Underwater/Awash Rock* feature covered by an obstruction area feature (*Obstruction* – see clause13.6).
* If it is required to encode an *Underwater/Awash Rock* feature where the attribute *value of sounding* is populated with an empty (null) value, but the source information indicates the depth of the feature is within the range of the surrounding depth area, the value *exposition of sounding* = _1_ (within the range of the surrounding depth area) must be populated in order to avoid the unnecessary display of isolated danger symbols in ECDIS.

__**Table 13-3 – Wrecks – Attribute encoding**__All wrecks should be encoded using one of the above combinations of attributes. \* For a wreck where the least depth is unknown, the attribute value _2_ (depth or least depth unknown) for *quality of vertical measurement* does not apply to the depth of the seabed near the wreck. The provision of more quantitative information for wrecks where possible is particularly important in terms of the portrayal of wrecks in ECDIS, as the classification of wrecks as "dangerous" or "non-dangerous" is not taken into account in ECDIS when symbolizing *Wreck* features outside *Unsurveyed Area*. This often results in wrecks located in *Depth Area* or *Dredged Area* being symbolized as an obstruction to navigation where they are actually non-dangerous. Where the depth of the wreck is unknown, compilers should consider determining an estimated safe clearance value (see S-4 – B-422.5) and populating *quality of vertical measurement* = _7_ (least depth unknown, safe clearance at value shown).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Only one of the attributes *category of wreck* or *value of sounding* must be populated, not both.
* The attribute *height* is only relevant for wrecks having attribute *water level effect* = _1_ (partly submerged at high water) or _2_ (always dry). Where *height* is populated, the attribute *value of sounding* must not be populated.
* The minimum depth, if known, over any submerged wreck, must be encoded using the attribute *value of sounding*. Where *value of sounding* is populated with an empty (null) value, display of the wreck in ECDIS as an underwater hazard, in accordance with the Mariner's selected safety depth, will be dependent on the value populated for the ECDIS "system" attribute *default clearance depth* (see clauses 2.4.5.1 and 30.1 and 8^th^ bullet below).
* An instance of the information type *Spatial Quality* (see clause 25.4) may be associated to the wreck geometry, using the association **Spatial Association**, to indicate, where required, that the horizontal position and/or the vertical uncertainty for the wreck is of different (higher or lower) accuracy than indicated by the underlying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* Meta feature (see clause 3.8). Where *Spatial Quality* is associated to the wreck and*height* (when *water level effect* = _1_ (partly submerged at high water) or _2_ (always dry)) or *value of sounding* is populated with an empty (null) value, the value for the complex attribute *vertical uncertainty* (*uncertainty fixed*) on the associated **Spatial Quality**, where required, must also be populated as empty (null). See also clause 3.8.1.3 (Sounding uncertainty).
* For reported, not confirmed wrecks, the date of the report must be populated, where known, using the attribute *reported date*.
* The distributed remains of a wreck must be encoded, where required, as a *Wreck* feature with attribute *category of wreck* = _3_ (distributed remains of wreck). Even though the wreck may be safe for surface vessels to navigate over the wreck, it must not be encoded as foul ground (see clause13.7).
* When encoding a *Wreck* feature, the attributes populated should adhere to the guidance in S-4 clause B-422. Where possible, this includes the population of the attributes *value of sounding* and *quality of vertical measurement* where the depth of a wreck is known, or the depth is unknown but an estimated safe clearance can be determined. Where the depth is known, or the depth is unknown but an estimated safe clearance has been determined, it is not required to populate the attribute *category of wreck* = _1_ (non-dangerous wreck) or _2_ (dangerous wreck), as the Mariner has the quantitative information in order to determine whether the wreck may be dangerous to their type of vessel.
* If it is required to encode a submerged *Wreck* feature where the attribute *value of sounding* is populated with an empty (null) value, but the source information indicates the depth of the feature is within the range of the surrounding depth area, the value *exposition of sounding* = _1_ (within the range of the surrounding depth area) must be populated in order to avoid the unnecessary display of isolated danger symbols in ECDIS.
* For wrecks visible or partly visible at sounding datum, the height or drying height should be encoded, if known. This helps to distinguish wrecks which are always visible from wrecks which are only visible at low tide.

[[sec_13.5.1.1]]
===== Where a wreck is shown with its true shape (large scale ENCs) (see S-4 – B-422.1)

Soundings and heights are often given inside a wreck to show the highest points of the hull or superstructure(for example mast, funnel). If it is required to encode such features, they must be done using:

* A *Wreck* feature of type surface with all populated attributes applying to the highest point of the wreck.
* *Land Elevation* features of type point to encode the features of the wreck that are always dry; the type of each feature (for example mast, funnel) may be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).
* *Sounding* features to encode the features of wrecks which are always submerged, or cover and uncover; the type of each feature (for example mast, funnel) may be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6), which means that these soundings must be encoded individually.

[[sec_13.5.1.2]]
===== Changing criteria for wrecks

Historically the criteria used for differentiating between "dangerous" and "non-dangerous" wrecks were often based on a threshold value for the estimated depth over the wreck (for example 20m, 28m). Criteria have varied between nations and over time (due to the increasing draught of large vessels). The term "non-dangerous wreck" may be applied even though a wreck may be dangerous to some vessels capable of navigating in the vicinity. Unfortunately, the Mariner is not necessarily aware of that fact or that, due to the changing criteria, wrecks encoded as "non-dangerous" may have different meanings. Ideally, therefore, all encoded "dangerous" and "non-dangerous" wrecks having no known depth should be re-assessed to conform to the guidance provided in S-4 – B-422.

[[sec_13.5.2]]
==== Historic wrecks (see S-4 – B-422)

Many nations have designated areas around certain wrecks of historical or cultural (for example sea graves) importance to protect the wrecks from unauthorised interference (for example by diving, salvage or anchoring). Such areas should be encoded on the largest optimum display scale ENC data covering the wreck.If it is required to encode a restricted area around a historic wreck, it must be done using a *Restricted Area* feature (see clause 17.8), with attribute *category of restricted area*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_10_ (historic wreck area).In addition, the wreck itself should be encoded as a *Wreck*feature, with attribute *status* = _13_ (historic).Distinction: Depth Area; Hulk; Obstruction; Sounding; Underwater/Awash Rock.

__**Table 13-4 – Obstructions – Attribute encoding**__All obstructions should be encoded using one of the above combinations of attributes.\* For an obstruction where the least depth is unknown, the attribute value _2_ (depth or least depth unknown) for *quality of vertical measurement* does not apply to the depth of the seabed near the obstruction.It is important when encoding obstructions to be aware of the distinction between attribute value *category of obstruction* = _6_ (foul area) and foul ground: Foul areas are defined as areas of numerous uncharted dangers to navigation. When encoded on ENC, *Obstruction* features of type surface with attribute *category of obstruction* = _6_ (foul area) will display in the ECDIS "base display" as an obstruction to navigation, with all associated alarms to indicate that it is unsafe for vessels to enter or transit the area.Foul ground is defined as an area over which it is safe to navigate but which should be avoided for anchoring, taking the ground or ground fishing. When encoded on ENC, *Foul Ground* features (see clause 13.7) of type surface will display in the ECDIS "other" display as a "foul area of seabed safe for navigation but not for anchoring", indicating to the Mariner that it is safe to enter or transit the area but hazardous to take the ground or undertake other subsurface activities.In some cases areas on the source indicated to be foul ground have been misinterpreted as foul areas, which has resulted in encoding in ENC of *Obstruction* with *category of obstruction* = _6_ (foul area). This encoding results in the incorrect indication in the ECDIS that the area is unsafe for navigation, which is potentially confusing to the Mariner.Foul ground, over which it is safe to navigate but which should be avoided for anchoring, taking the ground or ground fishing, should be encoded using a *Foul Ground* feature (see clause 13.7). Although the source may depict a "Foul Area", it should be determined whether it is in fact "Foul Ground" before encoding the appropriate feature.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Only one of the attributes *height* or *value of sounding* must be populated, not both.
* The minimum depth, if known, over any submerged obstruction, must be encoded using the attribute *value of sounding*. Where *value of sounding* is populated with an empty (null) value, display of the obstruction in ECDIS as an underwater hazard, in accordance with the Mariner's selected safety depth, will be dependent on the value populated for the ECDIS "system" attribute *default clearance depth* (see clauses 2.4.5.1 and 30.1 and 12^th^ bullet below).
* Where obstructions such as fish havens have a declared maximum authorised draught for vessels passing over the feature, this must be populated, where known, using the attribute *maximum permitted draught*.
* The attribute *height* must be populated for *Obstruction* features having attribute *water level effect* = _1_ (partly submerged at high water) or _2_ (always dry).
* *Obstruction* features having attribute *water level effect* = _7_ (floating) must have the attribute *height* populated with an empty (null) value.
* The attribute *vertical length* is used to populate the distance of an obstruction above the seabed; or the height of a floating obstruction above the sea surface.
* An instance of the information type *Spatial Quality* (see clause 25.4) may be associated to the obstruction geometry, using the association **Spatial Association**, to indicate, where required, that the horizontal position and/or the vertical uncertainty for the obstruction is of different (higher or lower) accuracy than indicated by the underlying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* Meta feature (see clause 3.8). Where *Spatial Quality* is associated to the obstruction and*height* or *value of sounding* is populated with an empty (null) value, the value for the attribute *vertical uncertainty* (*uncertainty fixed*) on the associated **Spatial Quality**, where required, must also be populated as empty (null). See also clause 3.8.1.3 (Sounding uncertainty).
* For reported, not confirmed obstructions, the date of the report must be populated, where known, using the attribute *reported date*.
* If the nature of a dangerous underwater feature, dangerous underwater area, or floating feature is not explicitly known, it must be encoded using *Obstruction*.
* An *Obstruction* feature of type surface must be covered by a surface feature from Skin of the Earth as appropriate.
* An area containing numerous dangers, through which navigation is not safe at the optimum display scale for the ENC data, should be encoded using an *Obstruction* feature of type surface, with attribute *category of obstruction*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_6_ (foul area).
* If it is required to encode a submerged *Obstruction* feature where the attribute *value of sounding* is populated with an empty (null) value, but the source information indicates the depth of the feature is within the range of the surrounding depth area, the value *exposition of sounding* = _1_ (within the range of the surrounding depth area) must be populated in order to avoid the unnecessary display of isolated danger symbols in ECDIS.
* Active submarine volcanos can be a significant navigational hazard; and harmful concentrations of volcanic gases emanating from active submarine volcanos can cover an extensive area (see S-4 – clause B-428.4). If it is required to encode an active submarine volcano, it must be done using an *Obstruction* feature of type point, with attributes *category of obstruction* = _21_ (active submarine volcano), *exposition of sounding* = _2_ (shoaler than the range of depth of the surrounding depth area) and *quality of vertical measurement* = _2_ (depth or least depth unknown). To indicate the unpredictable nature of the volcano (it may be periodically submerged or extend above the surface), the mandatory attributes *value of sounding* and *water level effect* must be populated with an empty (null) value. In order to raise the level of indication of the hazard in the ECDIS to the Mariner so as to generate an alarm, a small *Depth Area* feature having attribute *depth range minimum value* = _0_ may also be encoded. The area that can be potentially covered by harmful volcanic gases, which may cover an area of up to 10 NM from the volcano, should be encoded using a *Caution Area* feature (see clause 16.10), having the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6), sub-attributes *text* = _Volcanic activity_ and *file reference* carrying a reference to an appropriate cautionary note similar to:
_Active submarine volcanos exist in this area. Some volcanos have been reported to erupt breaking the surface of the sea and projecting ashes, other volcanic materials and harmful gases into the air. Changes to charted depths, uplifting of reefs and emerging of volcanic islets may occur throughout the area. Due to the unpredictable nature of these events Mariners are strongly recommended to avoid the area_.Inactive submarine volcanos must be encoded, if required, using a *Sea Area* feature (see clause 9.1).

* Platforms which have been cut-off above the seabed must be encoded as **Obstruction**, while platforms which have been cut-off to the level of the seabed should be encoded as *Foul Ground* (see clause13.7).
* In certain circumstances where an obstruction is always dry (for example cribs), it must be covered by a *Land Area* feature.
* Features that are considered to be subsurface Fish Aggregating Devices (FAD) must be encoded as **Obstruction**,with *category of obstruction* = _5_ (fish haven), unless the feature is a vessel that has been deliberately sunk to perform the function of a fish haven, which should be encoded as a *Wreck* feature (see clause 13.5).
* If it is required to encode a subsurface ocean data acquisition system (ODAS), whether on the seabed or suspended in the water column by a subsurface float, it must be done using *Obstruction* with *category of obstruction* = _14_ (subsurface ocean data acquisition system (ODAS)). An ODAS buoy must be encoded as a *Special Purpose/General Buoy* feature (see clause 20.5).

[[sec_13.6.1.1]]
===== Mangroves (see S-4 – B-312.4)

Where the source indicates that a mangrove area is in the intertidal area, an *Obstruction* feature of type area, with attribute *category of obstruction* = _23_ (mangrove) should be encoded on top of the portion of the intertidal area (*Depth Area* with attributes *depth range minimum value* = _-H_ and *depth range maximum value* = _0_ – see clause11.7.3) where the mangrove coverage exists. The mandatory attribute *water level effect* should be populated with _1_ (partially submerged at high water); and the conditional mandatory attribute *height* populated with the approximate altitude of the highest point of the top of the mangroves if known or an empty (null) value if not. The seaward spatial type(s) of the mangrove area should be associated to an instance of the information type *Spatial Quality* (see clause 24.5) having the attribute *quality of horizontal measurement* = _4_ (approximate). The landward edge of the mangrove area representing the high water line should be encoded as *Coastline* (see clause5.3), having no value populated for the attribute **category of coastline**, and no value for *quality of horizontal measurement* on the related spatial type(s).If it is required to encode an individual mangrove tree within the intertidal area, this must be done using an *Obstruction* feature of type point, with attribute *category of obstruction* = _23_ (mangrove).Where mangrove areas are required to be generalised on smaller optimum display scale ENC datasets such that the seaward edge of the mangrove only is to be indicated as the "apparent" coastline, this must be done using the feature *Coastline* (see clause 5.3).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The encoding of *Obstruction* of type curve and having attribute *category of obstruction* = _23_ (mangrove) is prohibited.

==== Foul ground (see S-4 – B-422.9)

If it is required to encode an area where seabed operations are unsafe, but over which it is safe to navigate for surface vessels, it must be done using the feature *Foul Ground*. Such areas are distinct from the feature **Obstruction**, attribute *category of obstruction* = _6_ (foul area), where navigation is considered to be unsafe for surface vessels (see clause 13.6).It is important when encoding foul ground to be aware of the distinction between foul ground and the feature **Obstruction**, attribute *category of obstruction* = _6_ (foul area) : Foul ground is defined as an area over which it is safe to navigate but which should be avoided for anchoring, taking the ground or ground fishing. When encoded on ENC, *Foul Ground* features of type surface will display in the ECDIS "other" display as a "foul area of seabed safe for navigation but not for anchoring", indicating to the Mariner that it is safe to enter or transit the area but hazardous to take the ground or undertake other subsurface activities.Foul areas are defined as areas of numerous uncharted dangers to navigation. When encoded on ENC, *Obstruction* features of type surface with attribute *category of obstruction* = _6_ (foul area) will display in the ECDIS "base display" as an obstruction to navigation, with all associated alarms to indicate that it is unsafe for vessels to enter or transit the area.It is recommended that if there is any doubt as to whether a feature should be encoded as *Obstruction* or **Foul Ground**, preference should be given to encoding the feature as *Obstruction* (see clause 13.6).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For reported, not confirmed foul ground, the date of the report must be populated, where known, using the attribute *reported date*.
* A *Foul Ground* feature of type surface must be covered by a surface feature from Skin of the Earth as appropriate (**Depth Area**, *Dredged Area* or *Unsurveyed Area*).
* Platforms which have been cut-off to the level of the seabed should be encoded as **Foul Ground**, while platforms which have been cut-off above the seabed must be encoded as *Obstruction* (see clause13.6).
* The distributed remains of wrecks must be encoded using the feature *Wreck* (see clause13.5), and must not be encoded as *Foul Ground*.

==== Fishing facilities (see S-4 – B-447 and B-447.1-3)

Fishing facilities are usually sited in shallow water, but tunny nets are often located in deeper water. They can be very large and extend up to several miles offshore; and form an obstruction to navigation.If it is required to encode a fishing facility it must be done using the feature *Fishing Facility*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The attribute *vertical length* is used to populate the distance of the facility above the seabed.
* Certain types of fishing facilities such as tunny nets in deep water may be an obstruction to navigation. If *Fishing Facility* features are considered to be an obstruction or hazard to navigation, they should also be encoded with an *Obstruction* feature (see clause 13.6). Although this is contrary to ENC encoding principles (that is, double encoding), this solution is recommended for portraying dangers to navigation of this nature in the ECDIS.
* Floating fish aggregating devices (FAD) must be encoded, where required, as *Special Purpose/General Buoy* features (see clause 20.5). Subsurface FADs (fish havens) must be encoded, where required, as *Obstruction* features (see clause 13.6).

==== Marine farms (see S-4 – B- 447.4 and B-447.6)

Marine farmsare collections of cages, nets, rafts and floats, or posts, where fish, including shellfish, are reared. They may obstruct navigation, and are likely to be marked by buoys and possibly lights. They are not always confined to inshore locations. Shellfish bedsare found in shallow water. Depending on vessel draught and tidal range, it is usually possible to navigate over them, at high water, but they can be damaged by vessels anchoring or grounding on them.If it is required to encode a marine farm, it must be done using the feature *Marine Farm/Culture*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* When it is required to encode the minimum depth of the feature, the attributes *exposition of sounding* and *quality of vertical measurement* and the mandatory attribute *value of sounding* must be used. When a *Marine Farm/Culture* feature covers an area of the seafloor at the optimum display scale of the data, the value of the attribute *value of sounding* represents the minimum depth, if known, over any structure used to form or support the marine farm, or within the area of the marine farm itself. The mandatory attribute *water level effect* must be used to encode the water level of the shallowest section of the area, if partly or completely under water.
* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.
* The attribute *height* must be populated for *Marine Farm/Culture* features having attribute *water level effect* = _1_ (partly submerged at high water) or _2_ (always dry).
* The attribute *vertical length* is used to populate the distance of the marine farm above the seabed.
* Where required, ground tackle associated with marine farms must be encoded as *Obstruction* features (see clause 13.6).

[[sec_13.10.2]]
==== Fish havens (see S-4 – B- 447.5)

If it is required to encode a fish haven, it must be done using an *Obstruction* feature (see clause 13.6), with attribute *category of obstruction*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_5_ (fish haven).Distinction: Fishing Facility; Obstruction.

[[sec_14.1.1]]
==== Offshore platforms (see S-4 – B-445.2; B-445.4 and B-445.5)

Several different types of platforms are in use. They are normally piled steel or concrete structures, the latter held in position on the seafloor by gravity. Tension Leg Platforms(TLP) consist of semi-submersible platforms secured to flooded caissons on the seafloor vertically below them by wires kept in tension by the buoyancy of the platform.Platforms may serve a number of purposes. They may carry any of the following equipment: drilling and production equipment; oil and gas separation and treatment plants; pump-line stations; and electricity generators. They may be fitted with cranes, a helicopter landing deck, and accommodation for up to 350 people. Platforms may stand singly or in groups connected by pipelines. Some stand close together in a complex, with bridges and underwater cables connecting them. Unwanted gas or oil is sometimes burnt from a flaring boom extending from the platform or from a nearby flare stack.If it is required to encode a permanent offshore platform, it must be done using the feature *Offshore Platform*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The attribute *height* is only relevant for fixed platforms, and is referred to the vertical datum (see clause2.5.7).
* The attribute *vertical length* is only relevant for floating platforms, and is referred to the sea level.
* If it is required to encode sites of dismantled platforms, this must be done using *Foul Ground* features (see clause 13.7), unless the source indicates that any remaining structure protrudes far enough above the seabed so as to be an obstruction to surface navigation, in which case this must be encoded using an *Obstruction* feature (see clause13.6).
* Platforms may carry lights (see Section 19), fog signals (see clause 20.19), helicopter landing pads (see clause 6.5) and flare stacks. Where fitted, lights should be encoded as described in Section 19, with the *Offshore Platform* being used as the structure feature for the light equipment feature(s).

[[sec_14.1.2]]
==== Wellheads (see S-4 – B-445.1)

In the course of developing an oil or gas field, numerous wells may be drilled. Some, which will not be required again, may be sealed at or below the seafloor and abandoned; such wells must not be encoded, as they have no relevance to navigation.A submerged wellheadis a submarine structure projecting some distance above the seafloor and capping a temporarily abandoned (or "suspended") oil or gas well. Their associated pipes and other equipment usually project some 2 - 6 metres, but in some cases as much as 15 metres, above the seafloor. Some may be covered by steel cages to avoid snagging trawling gear. In certain instances, a wellhead may project above the sea surface. Wellheads must be encoded on at least the largest optimum display scale ENC data, together with associated buoys, as a hazard to fishing and, dependent on depth, as a hazard to deep-draught vessels and towed structures.If it is required to encode wellheads, this must be done using *Obstruction* features of type point (see clause 13.6), with attributes:*category of obstruction*- _2_ - wellhead**height****status**- _4_ - not in use (disused)**value of sounding****vertical length**- vertical length of the wellhead above the seabed**water level effect**- _2_ - always dry (for wellheads that protrude at high water)_3_ - always under water/submerged

[[sec_14.1.3]]
==== Offshore safety zones (see S-4 – B-445.6)

Under UNCLOS, a coastal State may establish safety zones around artificial islands, installations and structures in their EEZ and on their continental shelf. These installations include drilling rigs, production platforms, wellheads, moorings and other associated structures. Safety zones normally extend 500 metres from the outermost points of the installations. Within these zones, appropriate measures can be taken to ensure the safety of navigation and of the installations.If it is required to encode an offshore safety zone, it must be done using a *Restricted Area* feature (see clause 17.8), with attribute *category of restricted area*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_1_ (offshore safety zone).

[[sec_14.1.4]]
==== Offshore flare stacks (see S-4 – B-445.2)

As with refineries on land, offshore terminals may burn off gas from production platforms or from "flare stacks" set up as separate structures at a short distance from the production platforms.If it is required to indicate the presence of a flare stack on an offshore platform, it must be done through population of the Boolean attribute *flare stack* = _True_.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Flare stacks on land must be encoded, if required, using a *Landmark* feature (see clause7.2).

==== Submarine cables (see S-4 – B-443; B-443.1-2 and B-443.7-8)

Submarine cables are used to carry power or telecommunications. All power cables and most telecommunication cables carry dangerous voltages. Submarine cables are potential hazards to both vessels and life, particularly to fishing vessels engaged in trawling the seabed. Where possible, submarine cables are now buried beneath the seafloor in water depths of less than 1000 metres; however there remains a large percentage unburied. Submarine cables are vulnerable to damage from anchoring, trawling or other seabed operations; even small craft anchors can penetrate a soft seabed sufficiently to foul a cable. Damage to telecommunication cables can lead to extensive disruption of national and international communications, whilst damage to power cables can disrupt electricity supply.Submarine cables, including disused cables, should be encoded to indicate their presence to vessels engaged in anchoring, trawling or seabed activities in order to:

* Warn Mariners of the potential hazard to their vessel, including electric shock to any vessel fouling or breaking the cable, possible capsize of a small vessel if its fishing gear or anchor is trapped under the cable, or loss of gear (trawls or anchor cables).
* Prevent damage to the cable and avoid disrupting the service the cable may be providing.
Active cables should be encoded to a depth of 2000 metres (which is the deepest depth of water to which vessels may be endangered by fouling the cable).If it is required to encode a submarine cable, it must be done using the feature *Cable Submarine*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If the buried depth varies along the cable, the cable must be encoded as several features.
* Telecommunications cables such as telephone and optic fibre cable must be populated, where required, by populating attribute *category of cable* = _10_ (telecommunications cable).
* Where a cable is disused, it should be encoded with the attribute *status* = _4_ (not in use), and the attribute *category of cable* should not be encoded. Few disused cables are recovered and so to encode them all would lead to clutter in the data. Also, accurate records of their positions are likely to be incomplete (some cables having been cut or dragged out of position), so there is a case for encoding them very selectively. Where disused cables traverse possible anchorages or where there is known seabed activity, for example trawling grounds, they should be encoded on the largest optimum display scale ENC data covering the area, provided they do not obscure more important information.
* In certain circumstances, high voltage power cables may cause a deviation in a ship's magnetic compass; in these cases, where reports have been received, they should be treated as local magnetic anomalies (see clause4.2).
* If it is required to provide the contact details of cable owners/operators (in cases of damage to a cable or for reparation for loss of an anchor in order to avoid such damage), this must be done using an associated instance of the information type *Contact Details* (see clause 24.1).
* Cables, buried so deep that they are not vulnerable to damage from anchoring, should not be encoded (so that Mariners are not unnecessarily inhibited from anchoring or fishing). In marginal cases they may be encoded as *Cable Submarine* with the nominal depth to which they are buried encoded using the attribute *buried depth*.
* For encoding cables for mooring trots, see clause 8.23.

* Where populated, the attribute *status* must only be used to encode the status of the area and not the status of the cables in the area.
* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.
* The outer limits of a cable area must enclose the area in which anchoring and certain forms of fishing are prohibited or inadvisable; that is, the limits must lie a safe distance beyond the actual lines of the outermost cables.
* If it is required to provide the contact details of cable owners/operators (in cases of damage to a cable or for reparation for loss of an anchor in order to avoid such damage), this must be done using an associated instance of the information type *Contact Details* (see clause 24.1).

==== Pipelines, submarine or on land (see S-4 – B-377; B-444; B-444.1-2; B-444.4-5 and B-444.7)

Submarine pipelines can be divided into two main categories:

* Oil, chemical, gas and water supply pipelines are an important feature of many areas. The pipes are generally encased in concrete for protection and to give them negative buoyancy, which can significantly increase their external diameter. Pipelines are generally laid directly on the seabed, with sections over local dips or hollows being supported physically from beneath. In some cases (for example in shallow water or near the shore), where the external diameter of the pipeline would represent a significant reduction in the water depth above it, the pipelines may be laid in trenches and possibly buried.
In all cases it must be assumed that the pipes are vulnerable to damage from anchoring or trawling, although in a few cases concrete domes are used to protect particularly vulnerable junctions. Gas pipes present a severe hazard to ships damaging them (by fire, explosion, or possibly loss of buoyancy). Oil and chemical pipes are a danger to the environment if fractured. Damage to water pipes supplying residential areas, mainly islands, results in disruption or contamination of the water supply. In the above cases, submarine pipelines must be encoded on all appropriate optimum display scale ENC datasets.

* Outfalls and intakes such as sewers, and cooling water intakes, are mainly a feature of inshore waters. For small craft, in particular, such pipes are a potential danger to navigation. The pipes are also vulnerable to damage. They should be encoded on at least the largest optimum display scale ENC datasets.
If it is required to encode a submarine or land pipeline, it must be done using the feature *Pipeline Submarine/On Land*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* A pipeline that extends vertically from the seabed must be encoded, if required, as an *Obstruction* feature (see clause 13.6). A vertical pipeline on land must be encoded, if required, as a *Landmark* feature (see clause 7.2).
* If the buried depth varies along a submerged pipeline, the pipeline must be encoded as several features.
* The attributes *depth range minimum value* and *depth range maximum value* are used to encode the shallowest and deepest depth over the pipeline.
* Where a bubble curtain pipeline is intended for the retention of oil, this must be encoded as an *Oil Barrier* feature (see clause 16.21), with attribute *category of oil barrier* = _1_ (oil retention – high pressure pipe).
* Where a pipeline is disused, it should be encoded with the attribute *status* = _4_ (not in use), and the attributes *category of pipeline/pipe* and *product* should not be encoded.
* The term "sub-surface pipeline" is used to describe a pipeline that is "floating" in the water column (see S-4 – B-444.9). If it is required to encode a sub-surface pipeline, this should be done using a *Pipeline Submarine/On Land* feature, with the attribute *depth range minimum value* populated with the minimum design depth over the pipeline. The attribute *depth range maximum value* may be populated with the maximum design depth over the pipeline. A picture file may be referenced using the attribute *pictorial representation* (see clause 2.4.12.2) if it is considered useful, for example a schematic diagram showing the clearances along the pipeline.
* If it is required to provide the contact details of submerged pipeline owners/operators (in cases of damage to a pipeline or for reparation for loss of an anchor in order to avoid such damage), this must be done using an associated instance of the information type *Contact Details* (see clause 24.1).
* Submarine pipes, buried so deep that they are not vulnerable to damage from anchoring, should not be encoded (so that Mariners are not unnecessarily inhibited from anchoring or fishing). In marginal cases they may be encoded as *Pipeline Submarine/On Land* with the nominal depth to which they are buried encoded using the attribute *buried depth*.
* Buried pipelines on land should not be encoded.

[[sec_14.4.2]]
==== Diffusers, cribs

If it is required to encode diffusers and cribs, this must be done using *Obstruction* features (see clause 13.6), with attribute *category of obstruction* = _3_ (diffuser) or _4_ (crib).Distinction: Pipeline Overhead, Submarine Pipeline Area.

==== Offshore production areas (see S-4 – B-445.3; B-445.7; B-445.9; B-445.11 and B-445.12)

Oil and gasfields are exploited in many parts of the world. Although the basic methods for extracting oil and gas are well established, details of the systems and structures may vary with the characteristics of the different fields and are continually being developed. In a typical field, oil or gas is obtained from wells drilled from fixed production platforms, usually standing on the seabed. From each production platform, the oil or gas is carried in pipes to a facilities platform where primary processing, compression and pumping are carried out. The oil or gas is then transported through pipelines to a nearby storage tank, tanker loading buoy or floating terminal, or direct to a tank farm on shore. One facilities platform may collect the oil or gas from several production platforms, and may supply a number of tanker loading buoys or storage units. Such facilities platforms are sometimes termed Field Terminal Platforms. Converted tankers or purpose-built vessels are often permanently moored and used as facilities platforms, floating terminals, and for storage. Other offshore energy production facilities include wind turbines and underwater current turbines. Other methods of harnessing tidal wave and solar energy are also in use.If it is required to encode an offshore production area, it must be done using the feature *Offshore Production Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.
* General information about a wind farm such as blade diameter and blade vertical clearance should be encoded, if required, using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6). If it is required to encode individual offshore wind turbines, it should be done using a *Wind Turbine* feature (see clause 7.4).
* If it is required to encode individual wave energy devices or underwater turbines within a wave or current farm (or turbine field), it should be done using an *Obstruction* feature (see clause 13.6) or, if there are associated surface structures, using appropriate features, for example*Offshore Platform* or *Special Purpose/General Beacon* (see clauses 14.1 and 20.12). The extent and nature of any restricted area related to the feature should be encoded using a *Restricted Area* feature(see clause17.8).
* If it is required to encode an offshore development area, it should be done using an *Offshore Production Area* feature, with attributes *category of offshore production area* and *product* populated with the appropriate value; and *condition* = _1_ (under construction). A note describing the activities taking place within the area may be included using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6). At the conclusion of the development of the area, the attribute *condition* and any associated note can then be removed from the feature.

[[sec_14.6.2]]
==== Offshore tanker loading systems (see S-4 – B-445.4)

Although the oil and gas from some fields are sent ashore by submarine pipeline, a variety of mooring systems have been developed for use in deep water and in the vicinity of certain ports, to allow the loading of large vessels and the permanent mooring of floating storage vessels or units. These offshore systems include large mooring buoys, designed for mooring vessels up to 500,000 tonnes, and platforms on structures fixed at their lower ends to the seafloor. They allow a vessel to moor forward or aft to them, and to swing to the wind or stream. Those which are fixed are termed Single Point Moorings(SPM). Those which are a form of mooring buoy are termed Single Buoy Moorings(SBM). Like production platforms, SPM and SBM normally have lights and fog signals.If it is required to encode an offshore tanker loading system, it must be done using the feature *Installation Buoy* (see clause 20.7).If it is required to encode an articulated tower, it must be done using an *Offshore Platform* feature (see clause 14.1), with attribute:*category of offshore platform* - _4_ - articulated loading platform__5__ - single anchor leg mooring__8__ - floating production, storage and off-loading vessel__10__ - navigation, communication and control buoy (which may include storage facilities)Distinction: Exclusive Economic Zone; Offshore Platform; Wind Turbine.

If it is required to encode leading, clearing and transit lines and recommended tracks, it must be done using the features *Navigation Line* and *Recommended Track*(see clauses 15.4 and 15.5), and related point navigational aids features (see Section 20). This applies for visual and radio navigational aids.

NB. In North America the word "range" is used instead of "transit" and "leading line".

[[sec_15.1.1]]

=== Traffic Lanes

A traffic lane is an area within defined limits in which one way traffic is established. Natural obstacles, including those forming separation zones may constitute a boundary (IMO Ships' Routeing). These lanes of travel may be composed of the following features: *Traffic Separation Scheme Lane Part* and *Deep Water Route Part*.

[[sec_15.3]]
=== Traffic separation schemes and traffic separation scheme systems (see S-4 – B-435.1-3)

A traffic separation scheme is a routeing measure aimed at the separation of opposing streams of traffic by appropriate means and by the establishment of traffic lanes (IMO Ships' Routeing). A traffic separation scheme separates opposing streams of marine traffic by the establishment of separation zones or lines and traffic lanes. It may include inshore traffic zones or Deep Water routes. A separation zone or line separates:

. The traffic lanes in which ships are proceeding in opposite or nearly opposite directions;
. A traffic lane from the adjacent sea area; or
. Traffic lanes designated for particular classes of ships proceeding in the same direction.

If it is required to encode a traffic separation scheme, it must be done using:

- Deep Water routes (DW – a route within defined limits which has been accurately surveyed for clearance of sea bottom and submerged obstacles as indicated on the chart (IMO Ships' Routeing)). Deep Water routes are encoded using **Deep Water Route Centreline**; *Deep Water Route Part* and *Deep Water Route* features (see clauses15.13to 15.15);

- *Inshore Traffic Zone* (see clause 15.16);

- *Precautionary Area*(see clause 15.17);

For guidance on provision of advance notification of changes to traffic separation schemes, see clause 31.1.1.

To encode a traffic separation scheme (TSS) system, the **Deep Water Route Centreline**, **Deep Water Route Part**, **Inshore Traffic Zone**, **Precautionary Area**, **Separation Zone or Line**, **Traffic Separation Scheme Boundary**, **Traffic Separation Scheme Crossing**, **Traffic Separation Scheme Lane Part**, *Traffic Separation Scheme Roundabout* features must be associated with the *Traffic Separation Scheme* (see clause15.23) using the association *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* (see clause 25.18). The *Traffic Separation Scheme* may additionally be associated to the aids to navigation marking the components of the Scheme (if they are stated in the regulation defining the TSS or Deep Water route) using the association *Aids to Navigation Association* (see clause 25.2). Where it is required to indicate the name of the complete TSS, this must be done using the attribute feature name for the *Traffic Separation Scheme*. Where it is required to populate textual information for the TSS, this should be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) for the *Traffic Separation Scheme*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Traffic separation scheme systems may be included with other routeing measures such as Deep Water or two-way routes, or another traffic separation scheme system, to comprise a complete traffic routeing system. To encode the relationship between routeing measures, the named association defining each routeing measure within the system (or the relevant feature if the routeing measure consists of a single feature) may be associated using a *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* to form a hierarchical relationship (see clause25.18). The individual elements comprising different routeing measures must not be aggregated into a single named association.
* All features comprising a TSS, TSS system or deep water route must have the same value populated for the attribute *scale minimum* (see clause 2.5.9).

==== Navigation lines (see S-4 – B-433)

Clearing Linesare important in rocky areas where dangers are not guarded by buoys and where sailing vessels (which are not always able to keep to a direct track) and other small craft may navigate close inshore. Transits marking isolated dangers are based on beacons or other marks which are erected on shore to indicate (approximately, unless there are two pairs of beacons) the position of an isolated danger. Leading lines based on beacons or lights must be encoded where the optimum display scale for the ENC data permits. Leading lines based on natural features should be encoded on the largest optimum display scale ENC data where they appear to be useful, particularly if other navigational aids seem inadequate.If it is required to encode a navigation line, it must be done using the feature *Navigation Line*.The use of *Navigation Line* and *Recommended Track* (see clause 15.5) is defined in more detail in the following Table, and in Figure 15-4 below:

==== Measured distances (see S-4 – B-458)

If the track to be followed is on a leading line or a bearing, it must be encoded in the way described in the Table and Figure 15-4 above (cases 1 or 4). If the track is not on a leading line or bearing, it must be encoded only as a *Navigation Line* feature with the attribute *category of navigation line* being set to an empty (null) value. In either case, if it is required to encode the measured distance, it must be done using the attribute *measured distance*.If it is required to encode the transit lines, they must be done using *Navigation Line* features, with *category of navigation line* = _2_ (transit line).If it is required to encode the beacons, they must be done using *Special Purpose/General Beacon* features, with attribute *category of special purpose mark* = _17_ (measured distance mark).On occasions, one or more of the transits used for the measured distance may incorporate an existing landmark as the front or rear mark. In this case, if *Landmark* is encoded, *category of special purpose mark* = _17_ must also be populated.Where the entire measured distance system exists within a single dataset, each transit line with its beacons must be associated with the feature *Range System* (see clause15.6) using the association *Range System Aggregation* (see clause 25.13). These two associations and the track to be followed must be associated with another instance of *Range System* to form a hierarchical relationship.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* All features comprising a measured distance must have the same value populated for the attribute *scale minimum* (see clause2.5.9).

==== Recommended tracks (see S-4 – B-432.1; B-434 and B-434.1-4)

Recommended tracks and fairways usually comprise a number of sections (sometimes termed "legs") which lead between dangers lying close on both sides of the track or fairway. Tracks commonly include some sections which are leading lines (see clause15.1). The distinction between tracks and fairways, in this context, is that tracks have no specified outer limits and fairways do have specified outer limits.It is important to recognise that it is not the role of cartographers to create "recommended" tracks and other "recommended" routeing measures; such recommendations are made by other authorities. The word "Recommended", used in connection with recommended tracks and other recommended routeing measures usually implies that it has been recommended by a competent authority (such as a port authority within its port limits or a maritime safety authority) and may be adopted by IMO. Occasionally, the recommendation may be based on advice directly from a competent surveyor or established by precedent.Recommended tracks include all channels recommended for hydrographic reasons to lead safely between shoal depths. The use of such tracks is generally left to the discretion of the Mariner and will depend on the vessel's draught, the state of the tide, adequacy of navigational aids and so on.If it is required to encode a recommended track, it must be done using the feature *Recommended Track*.The use of *Navigation Line* and *Recommended Track* is defined in more detail in the following Table, and in Figure 15-5 below.

* The attribute *depth range minimum value* is used to encode the shallowest depth along the track, where required.
* The attribute *maximum permitted draught* is used to encode the maximum draught permitted on the track, where required.
* The recommended track is that portion of a navigation line (see clause15.4) that a ship should use for navigation (see Figure 15-5 above).
* In the case of a two-way recommended track, only one value of orientation is encoded (in the mandatory attribute *orientation value*); the other value can be deduced (that is, the value in *orientation value* + 180 degrees). The value of orientation encoded on *orientation value* should be the value of the bearing from seaward. If it is not possible to define a seaward direction, the value that is less than 180° should be used.
* When the traffic flow along a recommended track is one way (attribute *traffic flow* = __1__, _2_ or _3_), the resultant direction of the line (accounting for the direction of digitising and any subsequent reversal of the line) associated with the *Recommended Track* must be the same as the direction of the traffic flow, in order to ensure the correct representation in the ECDIS of the direction to be followed.

==== Range systems (see S4 – B-433)

If it is required to encode leading, clearing and transit lines and recommended tracks, it must be done using the features *Navigation Line* and *Recommended Track* (see clauses15.4and 15.5), and related point navigational aids features (see Sections 18-21). This applies for visual and radio navigational aids.To encode a range system, the features **Navigation Line**, **Recommended Route Centreline**, *Recommended Track* and the navigational aids features should be associated with the feature *Range System* using the association *Range System Aggregation* (see clause 25.13).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The name of the range system may be populated using the complex attribute *feature name*. Where it is required for the name to be displayed in the ECDIS, the *Range System* must be encoded using curve or surface geometry. The extent of the geometry of the *Range System* should utilise the geometry of the components of the system so as to cover its full extent.
* All features comprising a range system must have the same value populated for the attribute *scale minimum* (see clause 2.5.9).
* Multiple *Range System* features may be further aggregated hierarchically using the association *Range System Aggregation* to define a higher level range system.

==== Fairways (see S-4 – B-432.1(c) and B-434.5)

A fairway, sometimes called Ship Channel, is the main navigable channel in the approaches to, or within, a river or harbour. Fairways which are designated by a regulatory authority are treated as Routeing Measures.If it is required to encode a fairway, it must be done using the feature *Fairway*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The attribute *depth range minimum value* is used to encode the shallowest depth in the fairway, where known.
* The attribute *maximum permitted draught* is permitted on *Fairway* only where the *Fairway* defines the entire system (that is, the *Fairway* has not been associated with other *Fairway* features and the feature *Fairway System* (see clause 15.8) to define a complete fairway system).

* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.
* Where beacons or buoys marking a fairway are offset from the actual fairway limits, this should be indicated using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).
* To encode a complete fairway system, the *Fairway* features may be associated with the feature *Fairway System* using the association *Fairway Aggregation* (see clause 25.7). The navigational aids features defining a fairway section may be associated with the *Fairway* using the association *Fairway Auxiliary* (see clause 25.8). Where it is required to indicate the name of a complete fairway system, this should be done using the complex attribute *feature name* for the *Fairway System* feature; or on a single *Fairway* feature where this feature defines the entire system. Where it is required to encode textual information for the fairway system, this should be done using the complex attribute *information*.

==== Fairway systems (see S-4 – B-432.1(c) and B-434.5)

A fairway, sometimes called Ship Channel, is the main navigable channel in the approaches to, or within, a river or harbour. Fairways which are designated by a regulatory authority are treated as Routeing Measures.A fairway system is composed of two or more *Fairway* features that comprise a complex fairway routeing system, for instance a long fairway comprising several bends. To define the complete fairway system, the *Fairway* features must be aggregated in a *Fairway System* feature, using the association *Fairway Aggregation* (see clause 25.7).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The name of the complete fairway system must be populated using the complex attribute *feature name*. Where it is required for the name to be displayed in the ECDIS, the *Fairway System* must be encoded using surface geometry. The extent of the geometry of the *Fairway System* should utilise the geometry of the components of the system so as to cover its full extent.
* All features comprising a fairway system must have the same value populated for the attribute *scale minimum* (see clause2.5.9).
* Where it is required to populate textual information for the fairway system, this should be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6), or if the information is considered essential for safe navigation, using a *Caution Area* feature (see clause16.10).

==== Recommended routes (see S-4 – B-435.4)

A recommended route is a route of undefined width, for the convenience of ships in transit, which is often marked by centreline buoys. (IMO Ships Routeing, 2010). IMO-designated recommended routes are listed in IMO publication "__Ships' Routeing__"Part E. This type of routeing measure was adopted to include such features as the "transit routes" (through former minefields) in the entrances to the Baltic Sea. In contrast to recommended tracks (see clause15.5), there is usually ample sea-room for vessels to keep well starboard (to the right) of the centreline.If it is required to encode the centreline of a recommended route, it must be done using the feature *Recommended Route Centreline*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The attribute *depth range minimum value* is used to encode the shallowest depth on the route, where known.
* In the case of a recommended route centreline, only one value of orientation is encoded (in the attribute *orientation value*); the other value can be deduced (that is, the value in *orientation value* + 180 degrees). The value of orientation encoded on *orientation value* should be the value of the bearing from seaward. If it is not possible to define a seaward direction, the value that is less than 180° should be used.
* When the traffic flow is one way (attribute *traffic flow* = __1__, _2_ or _3_), the resultant direction of the line (accounting for the direction of digitising and any subsequent reversal of the line) associated with the *Recommended Route Centreline* must be the same as the direction of traffic flow, in order to ensure the correct representation in the ECDIS of the direction to be followed.

==== Two-way Routes (see S-4 – B-435.6)

A two way route is a route within defined limits inside which two way traffic is established, aimed at providing safe passage of ships through waters where navigation is difficult or dangerous (IMO Ships Routeing, 2010). It consists of one or more areas within which traffic flows in two directions along one bearing and/or its reciprocal. Such routes are established by regulatory authorities and may be adopted by IMO. IMO-designated two-way routes are listed in IMO publication "__Ships' Routeing__"Part E. When it is required to encode these areas, this must be done using the feature *Two-Way Route Part*. These route parts will generally be two-way, but some may be restricted to one-way traffic flow.__**Fimage::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_bc034dbe.gif[Shape33,359,213]
 igure 15-6 – One-way traffic flow in a two-way route**__If it is required to encode a two-way route with one-way sections, separate *Two-Way Route Part* features must be encoded for the different parts, with attribute *traffic flow* = _3_ (one-way) or _4_ (two-way). In one-way sections, the mandatory attribute *orientation value* must indicate the true direction of traffic flow, not its reciprocal. In two-way sections, *orientation value* may indicate either direction of traffic flow. Remarks:

* The orientation of the two-way route part is defined by the centreline of the part and is related to the general direction of the two-way route.
* The attribute *depth range minimum value* is used to encode the shallowest depth on the part, where required.
* To encode a complete Two-way route, the *Two-Way Route Part* features must be associated with the feature *Two-Way Route* (see clause15.11) using the association *Two-Way Route Aggregation* (see clause 25.19). Where it is required to indicate the name of a complete two-way route, this should be done using the complex attribute *feature name* for the *Two-Way Route* feature. Where it is required to encode textual information for the complete two-way route, this should be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) for the *Two-Way Route* feature.
* All *Two-Way Route Part* features comprising a complete two-way route must have the same value populated for the attribute *scale minimum* (see clause 2.5.9).
* Two-way routes may be included with other routeing measures such as traffic separation schemes to comprise a complete traffic routeing system. To encode the relationship between routeing measures, the feature defining each routeing measure within the system (or the relevant feature if the routeing measure consists of a single feature) may be associated with the feature *Traffic Separation Scheme* (see clause 15.23) using the *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* (see clause25.18) to form a hierarchical relationship. The individual elements comprising different routeing measures must not be collected into a single *Traffic Separation Scheme* feature.

==== Recommended traffic lane part (see S-4 – B-435.5)

Recommended direction of traffic flow is a traffic flow pattern indicating a recommended directional movement of traffic where it is impractical or unnecessary to adopt an established direction of traffic flow. (IMO Ships Routeing, 2010). IMO-designated recommended directions of traffic flow are listed in IMO publication "__Ships' Routeing__"Part E. Several hydrographic offices, in consultation with their Ministries of Transport, have added recommended directions in areas such as the outer approaches to major ports in order to show the best routes for crossing traffic or to minimise the risk of head-on encounters.The feature *Recommended Traffic Lane Part* must be used, where required, to encode areas with a recommended direction of traffic flow which is generally along one bearing:

* between two traffic separation schemes (TSS) (INT1 – M 26.1);
* in the entrance area of a TSS; or
* along the outside of a Deep Water route (INT1 – M 26.2).
[underline]#Remarks:#

* When the area is not defined, a point feature should be encoded.
* The orientation of the recommended traffic lane part is defined by the centreline of the part and is related to the general direction of traffic flow in the recommended traffic lane.

[[sec_15.13.1]]
==== Deep Water route centrelines (see S-4 – B-435.3)

A complete Deep Water route (DW) consists of one or more areas within which the flow of traffic either follows one defined direction for one-way traffic, or follows one defined direction and its reciprocal for two-way traffic.If it is required to encode the centreline of a Deep Water route, the width of which is not explicitly defined, it must be done using the feature *Deep Water Route Centreline*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* In the case of a deep water route centreline, only one value of orientation is encoded (in the mandatory attribute *orientation value*); the other value can be deduced (that is, the value in *orientation value* + 180 degrees). The value of orientation encoded on *orientation value* should be the value of the bearing from seaward. If it is not possible to define a seaward direction, the value that is less than 180° should be used.
* When the traffic flow is one way (attribute *traffic flow* = __1__, _2_ or _3_), the resultant direction of the line (accounting for the direction of digitising and any subsequent reversal of the line) associated with the *Deep Water Route Centreline* must be the same as the direction of traffic flow, in order to ensure the correct representation in the ECDIS of the direction to be followed.
* The complex attribute *feature name*should only be used if the individual feature is not included in an association (see clause15.15.1).
* To encode a complete Deep Water route, the **Deep Water Route Centreline**,*Deep Water Route Part* features, and the navigational aids features (if they are stated in the regulation defining the DW), may be associated with the feature *Deep Water Route* (see clause15.15) using the associations *Deep Water Route Aggregation* (see clause 25.6) and *Aids to Navigation Association* (see clause25.2). Where it is required to indicate the name of a complete DW, this should be done using the complex attribute *feature name* for the *Deep Water Route* feature; or on a single *Deep Water Route Centreline* feature where this feature defines the entire DW. Where it is required to encode textual information for the DW, this should be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) for the *Deep Water Route* feature; or on a single *Deep Water Route Centreline* feature where this feature defines the entire DW.
* Deep Water routes, unlike dredged areas, are likely to be designated in offshore waters outside the immediate supervision of harbour authorities (although some do form the outer approaches to deep water ports). No least depth quoted can be fully guaranteed in most cases. Least depths within the route should be encoded by soundings as elsewhere on the ENC dataset so that the navigator will not assume that the depths are continually monitored. However, in those cases where a hydrographic authority feels confident to guarantee the existence of a minimum depth of water in a DW route, it must be populated using the attribute *depth range minimum value*.
* Deep water routes may be included with other routeing measures such as traffic separation schemes to comprise a complete traffic routeing system. To encode the relationship between routeing measures, the feature defining each routeing measure within the system (or the relevant feature if the routeing measure consists of a single feature) may be associated with the feature *Traffic Separation Scheme* (see clause 15.23) using the *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* (see clause 25.18) to form a hierarchical relationship. The individual elements comprising different routeing measures must not be collected into a single *Traffic Separation Scheme* feature.
* IMO-designated Deep Water routes are listed in IMO publication "__Ships' Routeing__"Part C. Where *Deep Water Route Centreline* features are included in the associations *Deep Water Route Aggregation* or **Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation**, the attribute *IMO adopted* must not be populated for the *Deep Water Route Centreline* features.

==== Deep Water route parts (see S-4 – B-435; B-435.3 and B-436.3)

A complete Deep Water route (DW) consists of one or more areas within which the flow of traffic either follows one defined direction for one-way traffic, or follows one defined direction and its reciprocal for two-way traffic.If it is required to encode these areas, this must be done using the feature *Deep Water Route Part*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.
* The complex attribute *feature name*should only be used if the individual feature is not included in an association (see clause 15.15.1).
* The route must be covered by *Depth Area* or *Dredged Area*features.
* A Deep Water route part may overlap a *Traffic Separation Scheme Lane Part* feature.
* To encode a complete Deep Water route, the **Deep Water Route Centreline**,*Deep Water Route Part* features, and the navigational aids features (if they are stated in the regulation defining the DW), may be associated with the feature *Deep Water Route* (see clause 15.15) using the associations *Deep Water Route Aggregation* (see clause 25.6) and *Aids to Navigation Association* (see clause25.2). Where it is required to indicate the name of a complete DW, this should be done using the complex attribute *feature name* for the *Deep Water Route* feature; or on a single *Deep Water Route Part* feature where this feature defines the entire DW. Where it is required to encode textual information for the DW, this should be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) for the *Deep Water Route* feature; or on a single *Deep Water Route Part* feature where this feature defines the entire DW.
* Deep Water routes, unlike dredged areas, are likely to be designated in offshore waters outside the immediate supervision of harbour authorities (although some do form the outer approaches to deep water ports). No least depth quoted can be fully guaranteed in most cases. Least depths within the route should be encoded by soundings as elsewhere on the ENC dataset so that the navigator will not assume that the depths are continually monitored. However, in those cases where a hydrographic authority feels confident to guarantee the existence of a minimum depth of water in a DW route, it must be populated using the attribute *depth range minimum value*.
* The orientation of the Deep Water route part is defined by the centreline of the part and is related to the general direction of traffic flow in the Deep Water route.
* Deep water routes may be included with other routeing measures such as traffic separation schemes to comprise a complete traffic routeing system. To encode the relationship between routeing measures, the feature defining each routeing measure within the system (or the relevant feature if the routeing measure consists of a single feature) may be associated with the feature *Traffic Separation Scheme* (see clause 15.23) using the *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* (see clause 25.18) to form a hierarchical relationship. The individual elements comprising different routeing measures must not be collected into a single *Traffic Separation Scheme* feature.
* IMO-designated Deep Water routes are listed in IMO publication "__Ships' Routeing__"Part C. Where *Deep Water Route Part* features are included in the associations *Deep Water Route Aggregation* or **Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation**, the attribute *IMO adopted* must not be populated for the *Deep Water Route Part* features.

==== Traffic separation scheme lanes (see S-4 – B-435.1)

A traffic lane is an area within defined limits in which one-way traffic flow is established. Natural obstacles, including those forming separation zones, may constitute a boundary. (IHO Dictionary – S-32). A complete traffic separation scheme lane consists of one or more areas within which the flow of traffic follows one defined direction. If it is required to encode these areas, this must be done using the feature *Traffic Separation Scheme Lane Part*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* At junctions, other than crossings and roundabouts, a separate *Traffic Separation Scheme Lane Part* feature must be encoded. For this feature, the attribute *orientation value* must be omitted, in order to avoid implying that one lane has priority over another (see INT1 – M22). Warning text may be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6). In some cases, a precautionary area is established where routes meet or cross (see clause 15.17.1).

* The orientation of the traffic separation scheme lane part is defined by the centreline of the part and is related to the general direction of traffic flow in the traffic separation lane.
* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.

==== Traffic separation schemes (see S4 – B-435.1-3)

If it is required to encode a traffic separation scheme (TSS), it must be done using:- Deep Water routes (DW – a route within defined limits which has been accurately surveyed for clearance of sea bottom and submerged obstacles as indicated on the chart. (IMO Ships Routeing, 2010)). Deep Water routes are encoded using **Deep Water Route Centreline**, *Deep Water Route Part* and *Deep Water Route* features (see clauses15.13 to 15.15);- *Inshore Traffic Zone* (see clause15.16);- *Precautionary Area*(see clause 15.17);- **Separation Zone or Line**, **Traffic Separation Scheme Boundary**, **Traffic Separation Scheme Crossing**, **Traffic Separation Scheme Lane Part**, *Traffic Separation Scheme Roundabout* (see clauses 15.18to 15.22); and- Navigational aids features (see Sections18 to 21).To define the complete traffic separation scheme system, these features must be associated with the feature *Traffic Separation Scheme* using the association *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* (see clause25.18); and any associated aids to navigation should be associated with the *Traffic Separation Scheme* using the association *Aids to Navigation Association* (see clause 25.2).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The name of the TSS must be populated using the complex attribute *feature name*. Where it is required for the name to be displayed in the ECDIS, the *Traffic Separation Scheme* must be encoded using surface geometry. The extent of the geometry of the *Traffic Separation Scheme* should utilise the geometry of the components of the scheme so as to cover its full extent.
* Where it is required to encode an IMO declared Area to be Avoided within a TSS, this must be done using the feature *Restricted Area* (see clause 17.8), with attribute *restriction* = _14_ (area to be avoided).
* Where it is required to populate textual information for the TSS, this should be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) for the **Traffic Separation Scheme**; or if the information is considered essential for safe navigation, using a *Caution Area* feature (see clause16.10).
* All features comprising a traffic separation scheme must have the same value populated for the attribute *scale minimum* (see clause2.5.9).
* Multiple *Traffic Separation Scheme* features may be further aggregated hierarchically using the association *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* to define a higher TSS.

==== Archipelagic Sea Lane area (see S-4 – B-435.10)

Article 53 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) states that: "an archipelagic State may designate sea lanes ..., suitable for the continuous and expeditious passage of foreign ships ... through ... its archipelagic waters and the adjacent Territorial Sea. ... All ships ... enjoy the right of archipelagic sea lanes passage in such sea lanes ... [which] include all normal passage routes used as routes for international navigation … through archipelagic waters". (Note: references to aircraft and air routes in UNCLOS have been omitted in these extracts from Article 53). (IHO S-4 B-435.10, C-51 Appendix 2 Part II).Any archipelagic State which wishes to designate Archipelagic Sea Lanes (ASL) must propose them to IMO for adoption as ASL including all normal passage routes and navigational channels as required by UNCLOS. ASL are adopted by IMO in accordance with the relevant provisions of UNCLOS.If it is required to encode an Archipelagic Sea Lane, it must be done using *Archipelagic Sea Lane Area* and/or *Archipelagic Sea Lane Axis* (see clause15.25) features, and possibly navigational aids features.The unique character of Archipelagic Sea Lanes (ASLs) is specified by UNCLOS Article 53 and Part H, General Provision of IMO Ships Routeing. Further information is provided in the IHO publication C-51 (Manual on Technical Aspects of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea).The encoding of relationships between these features is defined in clause 15.27.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The feature *Archipelagic Sea Lane Area* encodes the area of an Archipelagic Sea Lane.
* In some cases only accurate information on the axes (**Archipelagic Sea Lane Axis**, see clause15.25) may be available and in such cases the extents of the ASL (*Archipelagic Sea Lane Area*) may not be able to be encoded.
* To encode an Archipelagic Sea Lane (ASL) system, the **Archipelagic Sea Lane Area****,** *Archipelagic Sea Lane Axis* features, and any navigational aids features (if they are stated in the regulation defining the ASL), may be associated with the feature *Archipelagic Sea Lane* (see clause15.26) using the associations *ASL Aggregation* (see clause25.3) and *Aids to Navigation Association* (see clause25.2). Where the association *ASL Aggregation* has been created, it is not required to populate the attribute *nationality* on *Archipelagic Sea Lane Area*. Where it is required to indicate the name of a complete ASL system, this should be done using the complex attribute *feature name* for the *Archipelagic Sea Lane* feature. Where it is required to encode textual information for the ASL, this should be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).
* Traffic within an ASL is not separated, except in any traffic separation schemes which may be designated in an ASL for the safe passage of ships.
Distinction:Administration Area; Archipelagic Sea Lane; Archipelagic Sea Lane Axis; Caution Area; Fairway; Inshore Traffic Zone; Recommended Traffic Lane Part; Restricted Area; Separation Zone or Line; Submarine Transit Lane; Traffic Separation Scheme Lane Part; Two-Way Route Part.

==== Radio calling-in (reporting) points (see S-4 – B-488.1 and B-488.2)

Radio reporting points, also called radio calling-in points, have been established in certain busy waterways and port approaches to assist traffic control. On passing these points or crossing a defined line vessels are required to report on VHF to a Traffic Control Centre.If it is required to encode a radio reporting point or line, it must be done using the feature *Radio Calling-In Point*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Each *Radio Calling-In Point*feature of type point must carry at least one orientation, using the attribute *orientation value*. If it is required to encode the reciprocal orientation, to indicate that a bearing and its opposite apply to a *Radio Calling-In Point* feature, it must be done using attribute *traffic flow* = _4_ (two-way). If the same position is used for another orientation (not opposite) of traffic flow, a second *orientation value* attribute must be encoded.
* The complex attribute **feature name**, sub-attribute *name*is used to encode the name and/or alphanumeric designator of the *Radio Calling-In Point*.
* The complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) is used to provide additional information, where required. For example, if the requirement to report by radio relates to certain classes of vessels only.
* *Radio Calling-In Point* features of type curve must be encoded such that resultant direction of the line (accounting for the direction of digitising and any subsequent reversal of the curve) is related such that the direction of traffic that is required to report is to the right. For curve features, it is not required to populate *orientation value*.
* If it is required to encode the area of a Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) containing radio reporting points or requiring periodic position reporting, this should be done using the feature *Vessel Traffic Service Area* (see clause 22.2).
* Each VHF-channel should be indicated using the attribute *communication channel* (see clause 27.77). Alternately, if the same VHF-channel(s) apply to multiple features in the dataset, this should be indicated through an associated instance of the information type **Contact Details**, attribute *communication channel* (see clause24.1).

==== Ferries (see S-4 – B-438)

Ferry routes should be encoded on the largest optimum display scale ENC datasets:

** where they cross fairly narrow channels, in order that through traffic is warned of their existence;
** where the ferry tracks are short enough to be reasonably accurately represented; and
** on ENCs used for harbour navigation, as part of the general information about the area.
If it is required to encode a ferry route, it must be done using the feature *Ferry Route*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Long distance ferrieswhich have routes varying with weather, tide and traffic should not generally be encoded, although the terminals should be shown on appropriate optimum display scale ENC datasets, using the feature *Harbour Facility* (see clause22.7), with attribute *category of harbour facility* = _1_ (RoRo-terminal) or _3_ (ferry terminal).

Radar reference linesare mid-channel lines corresponding to lines incorporated in Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) radar displays. A line is used as a positional reference so that the VTS authorities may easily provide a vessel with its position, relative to the line, when visibility is poor. These must be charted on appropriate optimum display scale ENC data.If it is required to encode a radar reference line, it must be done using the feature *Radar Line*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The value of orientation encoded on the mandatory attribute *orientation value* should be the value of the bearing from seaward. If it is not possible to define a seaward direction, the value that is less than 180° should be used.
* If it is required to encode the area of a VTS containing radar lines, this should be done using the feature *Vessel Traffic Service Area* (see clause 22.2).

== Geo Features – Areas, limits

[[sec_16.1]]
=== International boundaries and national limits (see S-4 – B-440)

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), 1982 came into force on 16 November 1994. UNCLOS contains navigational provisions as well as provisions for determining the limits of various maritime zones. These provisions are binding to all states that have ratified the Convention. For technical aspects of UNCLOS, see IHO publication C-51.

IHO Member States should show, on selected series of their ENCs, their own baseline and maritime limits in accordance with UNCLOS.

The Mariner may be interested in the exact location of international maritime boundaries for two principal reasons:

* When crossing a boundary they could be subject to different laws and regulations which may affect their navigation; for example buoyage systems, pilotage regulations, fishing rights, reporting procedures, pollution regulations.

* Where a boundary passes through groups of offshore islands they may wish to know upon which side of the boundary a particular island falls.

.Maritime jurisdiction areas in constrained waters
image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_de8ddfa.png["",569,329]

The clauses in Section 16 below provide guidance for the encoding of maritime jurisdiction areas. Occasionally, these "areas" may actually be defined as linear due to international treaties; or the areas may not be fully defined and it may therefore be necessary to encode the boundary as a linear feature (see example at Figure 16-3 below). Clause 2.3 defining features permitted for use in ENC and their geometric primitives allows relevant feature classes relating to maritime jurisdiction areas to be encoded as type curve; however this must only be done in circumstances where it is not possible to encode the feature using geometric primitive surface.

[[fig_16-3]]
.Maritime jurisdiction – areas cannot be defined
image::figure-16-3.png[]

In Figure 16-3, Administration Areas A and B cannot be encoded using geometric primitive surface as the seaward edge of the areas is not defined. In this case, the section of the international boundary extending seaward from the low water line should be encoded as an *Administration Area* feature of type curve (see clause 16.8).

[[sec_16.2.1]]
==== Maritime jurisdiction areas in dispute

In accordance with Article 55 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS – 10 December 1982), a Coastal State's Territorial Sea Area and Exclusive Economic Zone must not overlap. Occasionally, small areas at the boundary of two or more Coastal States may be in dispute regarding the establishment of maritime jurisdiction, which may result in a small section of Territorial Sea overlapping an EEZ in the disputed area.

Where issues of maritime jurisdiction between two or more Coastal States are in dispute, the proposed Territorial Sea (*Territorial Sea Area*) of one Coastal State may overlap the proposed EEZ (*Exclusive Economic Zone*) of another Coastal State. In this case, the disputed area should be encoded with separate *Territorial Sea Area* and *Exclusive Economic Zone* features, with Boolean attribute *in dispute* set to _True_ and the mandatory attribute *nationality* populated with the country codes (conforming to ISO 3166) of the disputing states (see clause27.135).

==== Anchorages (see S-4 – B-431.1; B-431.3 and B-431.7)

Where the limits of anchorages are defined by a regulatory authority (for example harbour authority) they must be shown on the largest optimum display scale ENC data. They may also be shown on other optimum display scale ENC datasets where useful, for example, for planning purposes.If it is required to encode an anchorage area, including anchorages for seaplanes, it must be done using the feature *Anchorage Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The complex attribute **feature name**, sub-attribute *name*is used to encode the name and/or number of the *Anchorage Area*.
* The complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) may be used to provide additional information about the category of anchorage, where required.
* Individual recommended anchorages without defined limits should be encoded as *Anchorage Area* features of type point, with attributes *category of anchorage* = _1_ (unrestricted anchorage) and *status*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_3_ (recommended).
* If it is required to encode an anchorage at a location that has not been defined by a regulatory authority but has been reported to be suitable and safe for anchoring, this must be done using *Anchorage Area* of type point, with attribute *category of anchorage* = _15_ (reported anchorage). NOTE: the encoding of *Anchorage Area* with attribute *category of anchorage* = _15_ (reported anchorage) of type surface is prohibited.
* If it is required to encode an anchorage which may be used for a period of not more than 24 hours, it must be done using *category of anchorage* = _9_ (anchorage for periods up to 24 hours).
* If it is required to encode an anchorage with a specific, limited time period, it must be done using *category of anchorage* = _10_ (anchorage for limited period of time). The specific limit of time should be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6), sub-attribute *text* (for example_Anchorage limited to 12 hours_).
* Areas with numerous small craft moorings may be encoded using the feature *Mooring Area* (see clause 16.4). For the encoding of mooring buoys, see clause 20.8.
* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.
* Areas where anchoring is prohibited must be encoded, where required, as *Restricted Area* (see clause 17.8) with attribute *restriction* = _1_ (anchoring prohibited).

==== Dumping grounds (see S-4 – B-442; B-446 and B-446.1)

Materials deliberately dumped at sea in specified areas (other than those associated with reclamation works) may be classified, according to their significance to the Mariner, as follows:

** Materials which are generally dispersed before reaching the seabed, for example sewage sludge, are of little navigational significance and no charting action is usually required.
** Spoil from dredging operations or other works which might reduce charted depths significantly in the designated spoil ground.
** Harmful materials, including explosives and chemicals, which are likely to remain concentrated on the seabed.
Dumping of harmful materials is unlikely to affect depths substantially and such dumping grounds are encoded primarily as a warning against anchoring, trawling or other submarine operations.If it is required to encode a dumping ground, it must be done using the feature *Dumping Ground*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* A *Dumping Ground* feature of type surface must be covered by features from Skin of the Earth as appropriate (*Depth Area* or *Unsurveyed Area*).
* Disused dumping grounds for harmful materialsare considered dangerous for an indefinite period and must therefore be encoded on the largest optimum display scale ENC datasets, with attribute *status* = _4_ (not in use). The date when the area ceased to be used may be populated using the attribute **date disused**, if known.
* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.

[[sec_16.7.2]]
==== Spoil grounds, dredging areas (see S-4 – B-446)

Spoil grounds are areas set aside, clear of shipping channels and in deep water where possible, for the disposal of material (spoil) generally obtained by dredging. Their significance to the Mariner is that very large quantities of material may be dumped, decreasing the depth of water available. Where possible, charts should be updated in a timely manner so as to include the latest survey information covering the spoil ground.Extraction (or dredging) areas are those areas where a concentration of dredging vessels may be encountered, taking up sand or shingle to be brought ashore (for example for construction purposes). Their significance is primarily as a collision hazard, although they also indicate the likelihood of finding a greater depth of water than charted. Channels dredged to provide an adequate depth of water for navigation are "dredged areas", not to be confused with "dredging areas".If it is required to encode a spoil ground, it must be done using a *Dumping Ground* feature, with attribute *category of dumping ground*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_5_ (spoil ground).If it is required to encode a dredging area, it must be done using a *Restricted Area* feature (see clause 17.8), with attribute *category of restricted area*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_21_ (dredging area). An area in which seabed material (for example sand, shingle) is being extracted for purposes such as construction must be encoded, where required, using the feature *Offshore Production Area* (see clause 14.6), with attribute *category of production area* = _13_ (seabed material extraction area).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Within a spoil ground; if the depths within the area are liable to be very much less than charted after the discharge of spoil and post-dumping surveys are not available, they may be treated as unsurveyed areas (see clause11.10), in which case soundings and depth contours may be omitted from the area. Alternatively, an indication of the discrepancy between charted depth information and the actual depths within the spoil ground may be provided by downgrading the information included in the underlying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature (see clause 3.8).

==== Military practice areas (see S-4 – B-441.1-6)

Military practice (or exercise) areas at sea are of various types and may be classified as follows with regard to their significance for the Mariner:

* Firing danger areas, sometimes called firing practice areas; that is, permanent or temporary ranges, including bombing, torpedo and missile ranges.
* Mine-laying practice (and counter-measures) areas.
* Submarine exercise areas.
* Other exercise areas.
Some degree of restrictionon navigation and other rights may be implied by the encoding of military practice areas. There may be varying interpretations of the validity of the restrictions and possible infringement of the rights of innocent passage through territorial waters and elsewhere. Where it is thought desirable to depict such areas, even though clear range procedure may be observed, or the areas appear to be a derogation of the freedom of the seas, Mariners should be informed (not necessarily on ENCs) that publication of the details of a law or regulation is solely for the safety and convenience of shipping and implies no recognition of the international validity of the law or regulation. By this means infringements are not condoned but the Mariner receives a warning which may be necessary for their safety.If it is required to encode a military practice area, it must be done using the feature *Military Practice Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.
* Submarine exercise areas should generally not be encoded where submarines exercise over wide areas which it would not be practicable to depict, and over which cautions (to keep a good look out for them) are unlikely to be effective. They may, however, be encoded where they occur in or near major shipping lanes or port approaches.
* Firing danger areas at seaare frequently marked by IALA special buoys sometimes laid around the perimeter of the area and/or by specially erected lights, beacons and targets. If required, all such features which could assist the navigator in identifying their position, or could be a hazard, must be encoded in the normal way,
* The existence of mine laying (and counter-measures/clearance) practice areas implies the possibility of unexploded mines or depth charges on the seafloor, and also the presence of harmless practice mines.

==== International and national territories (see S-4 – B-440.1 and B-440.3)

International maritime boundariesare those which have been established by agreement between adjacent or opposite States. Boundaries are sometimes negotiated on the basis of the equidistance or "median" line principle. For various reasons, however, agreed boundaries even when negotiated on this principle are seldom true median lines. Navigationally, international boundaries may vary in their significance over different parts of their lengths. Inshore, they may represent the delimitation of Territorial Seas of two states or "internal waters", (for example within bay closing lines or straight baseline systems). Offshore, they may represent Exclusive Economic Zone and/or Continental Shelf boundaries.If it is required to encode a named international or national territory, it must be done using the feature *Administration Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* International land boundaries should be encoded, at least in the vicinity of coasts.
* *Administration Area* must only be encoded using the geometric primitive curve where the real-world instance is actually linear, and it is therefore not possible to encode the feature using the geometric primitive surface. See clause 16.2.

==== Cargo transhipment areas (see S-4 – B-449.4)

Areas generally outside port limits may be specifically designated as suitable for the transhipment of oil or other materials from large ships to smaller vessels. The areas selected are relatively sheltered locations and lie off main shipping routes. As the purpose of transhipment is usually to reduce the draught of the larger vessel to allow it to proceed to port, the operation is often known as "lightening" and the areas may be known as "lightening areas" or "cargo transfer areas".If it is required to encode a cargo transhipment area, it must be done using the feature *Cargo Transhipment Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For additional guidance regarding the encoding of vessel speed limits, see clause 17.4.
* The encoding of cargo transhipment areas should be adequate to warn other vessels of the likelihood of encountering ships restricted in their ability to manoeuvre. Regulations governing the use of such areas should be encoded using the attribute *restriction* or the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).

==== Caution areas (see S-4 – B-242)

If it is required to identify an area in which the Mariner must be aware of circumstances influencing the safety of navigation (for example an area of continually changing depths), and which cannot be encoded using other feature types, it must be done using the feature *Caution Area*. This feature may be required to identify a danger, a risk, a rule or advice that is not directly related to a particular feature.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If the information applies to a specific area the *Caution Area* feature should cover only that area.
* If the information to be encoded is spatially linear, this should be encoded using a "very narrow" *Caution Area* feature of type surface (approximately 0·3mm wide at the optimum display scale of the ENC data).
* Information which may be of use to the Mariner, but is not significant to safe navigation and cannot be encoded using other feature types, should be encoded using an *Information Area* feature (see clause 16.12). This encoding is intended to reduce the number of alarms or indications generated in the ECDIS due to the overuse of *Caution Area* features.
* Notes should be kept to a minimum and be as concise as is compatible with accuracy and intelligibility. Hydrographic terminology (jargon) should be avoided, giving preference to easily understood words, for example "depths" rather than "bathymetry".
* In order to ensure correct ECDIS display, *Caution Area* features of type surface should not share the geometry of features such as *Depth Contour* and other features with higher ECDIS display priorities (that is, higher than display priority 3), as the *Caution Area* will appear to be "open ended", which may confuse the Mariner. Where this occurs, the edge of the *Caution Area* should be extended outward to clear the "shared" edge, sufficient to avoid "duplicate geometry" validation errors (that is, at least 0.3mm at the optimum display scale for the ENC data).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The feature *Information Area* encodes information which the Producing Authority determines is relevant to the Mariner, but does not warrant the triggering of ECDIS alarms through the encoding of *Caution Area* features.
* If the information applies to a specific area the *Information Area* feature should cover only that area.

The Contiguous Zoneis a zone adjacent to the Territorial Sea where the coastal state may exercise the control necessary to prevent or punish infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or Territorial Sea. Under UNCLOS, the outer limits of this zone may not extend beyond 24 nautical miles measured from the Territorial Sea Baselines.If it is required to encode the Contiguous Zone, it must be done using the feature *Contiguous Zone*.

==== Fishery zones (see S-4 – B-440.7)

A fishery zoneis an area inside and beyond the Territorial Sea where a coastal State proclaims that it alone may regulate fishing. Where States have permitted others to fish in parts of the area, it may be desirable to encode the area of both the full area and the area of special concessionary rights. In some instances, claims are described as "conservation zones"; for practical purposes these may be classed with fishery zones since their intended function is to institute fishery conservation measures. Most of the fishery zone claims are limited by fixed distance (200 nautical miles in some cases) from the Territorial Sea baselines.If it is required to encode a fishery zone, it must be done using the feature *Fishery Zone*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Fishery zones commonly coincide with other national jurisdiction areas such as Continental Shelf and Exclusive Economic Zone. Where this occurs, Producing Authorities may choose to omit the *Fishery Zone* from the area covered by these other national jurisdiction areas, as the fact that fishing regulations apply in these areas is implicit.
* An indication of the fishery zone limit (for example 6 mile, 12 mile) may be encoded using the complex attribute *feature name*.

==== Straight Territorial Sea Baselines (see S-4 – B-440.4)

A Territorial Sea is delimited by:

* Territorial Sea Baselines (drying lines);
* Straight Territorial Sea Baselines;
* International maritime boundaries (see clause 16.1); and
* Seaward limits of Territorial Seas (see clause 16.2).
The term "Baseline" refers to the line from which the breadth of the Territorial Sea, the outer limits of the Contiguous Zone, the Exclusive Economic Zone and, in some cases, the Continental Shelf are measured. It is also the dividing line between internal watersand territorial seas. Internal waters comprise all areas of the sea on the landward side of the Territorial Sea Baselines, as well as inland waters including rivers, lakes, etc.The normal baselineis the low water line (which is not defined any more precisely by UNCLOS) of the mainland, islands, or low tide elevations, as depicted on large scale charts officially recognised by the coastal State; they therefore do not require depiction in ENCs. Features which are naturally-formed and dry at low water (for example rocks, reefs, sand banks) may be considered low-tide elevations and included in the baseline (details are given in UNCLOS - see IHO publication C-51).A straight baselinemay be used:

* as a closing line across the mouth or estuary of a river;
* as a closing line across the mouth of a juridical bay or a historical bay;
* as part of a system of Straight Territorial Sea Baselines, for example to connect seaward points on a deeply indented coastline, a coastline that is fringed with islands, around unstable coastlines; or
* as an archipelagic baseline.
If it is required to encode a Straight Territorial Sea Baseline, it must be done using the feature *Straight Territorial Sea Baseline*.

==== Submarine transit lanes (see S-4 – B-441.5)

Submarine transit lanes should not generally be encoded because submarines exercise over wide areas which it would not be practicable to depict, and over which cautions (to keep a good look out for them) are unlikely to be effective. They may, however, be encoded where they occur in or near major shipping lanes or port approaches.If it is required to encode a submarine transit lane, it must be done using the feature *Submarine Transit Lane*.

[[sec_17]]
== Geo Features – Restricted Areas – Overview

There are many types of areas within which certain activities are discouraged or prohibited, or from which certain classes of vessels are excluded. The general term for all areas in which certain aspects of navigation may be restricted or prohibited by regulations is "Restricted Area", or equivalent. The word "prohibited", or its equivalent, may appear in terms relating to activities which are contrary to the regulations, for example "Anchoring Prohibited", "Entry Prohibited".

If it is required to encode a restricted area, it must be done using the feature *Restricted Area* (see clause 17.8); or using other features having the attribute *restriction* (**Anchorage Area**, **Cable Area**, **Cargo Transhipment Area**, **Dumping Ground**, **Dredged Area**, **Deep Water Route Part**, **Fairway**, **Fishing Ground**, **Harbour Facility**, **Inshore Traffic Zone**, **Marine Farm/Culture**, **Military Practice Area**, **Offshore Production Area**, **Submarine Pipeline Area**, **Pipeline Submarine/On Land**, **Precautionary Area**, **Seaplane Landing Area**, **Submarine Transit Lane**, **Territorial Sea Area**, **Traffic Separation Scheme Crossing**, **Traffic Separation Scheme Lane Part**, *Traffic Separation Scheme Roundabout*).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The attribute *category of restricted area* is used to describe the reason for the regulation, while the attribute *restriction* describes the restrictions.
* The complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) may be used to provide an additional explanation about the regulation (for example the equivalent to a caution note from a paper chart), where required.
* An area in which regulations apply due to recreation activities such as water skiing, jet skiing, kite surfing and rowing must be encoded, where required, as *Restricted Area* with *category of restricted area* = _32_ (recreation area).
* If it is required to encode an area for which the Mariner must be made aware of circumstances influencing the safety of navigation, it must be done using the feature *Caution Area* (see clause16.10). This feature may be used to identify a danger, a risk, a rule or advice (for example an area of continually changing depths) which is not directly related to a particular feature.

[[sec_17.1]]
=== Minefields (see S-4 – B-441.8)

If it is required to encode a minefield, it must be done using a *Restricted Area* feature (see clause17.8), with attribute *category of restricted area* = _14_ (minefield). Former mined areas should also be encoded with attribute *status* = _4_ (not in use).

[[sec_17.2]]
=== Degaussing ranges (see S-4 – B-448)

A degaussing (or demagnetising) range is an area, usually of about 0.2M diameter, within which ships' magnetic fields may be measured. Sensing instruments and cables are installed on the seafloor in the range and there are cables leading from the range to a control position ashore. The range is usually marked by distinctive buoys. The significance of a degaussing range to Mariners is that anchoring and trawling are prohibited and that the range may have to be avoided when vessels are using it.

If it is required to encode a degaussing range, it must be done using a *Restricted Area* feature (see clause17.8), with attribute *category of restricted area*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_8_ (degaussing range).

[[sec_17.3]]
=== Nature reserves (see S-4 – B-437.3)

If it is required to encode a marine nature reserve area, it must be done using a *Restricted Area* feature (see clause17.8), with attribute *category of restricted area*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_4_ (nature reserve).

[[sec_17.4]]
=== Speed limits (see S-4 – B-430.2)

Speed is often limited inside harbours in order to prevent wakes. If it is required to encode this restriction, it must be done usinga *Restricted Area* feature (see clause17.8), with the attribute *category of restricted area* = _24_ (no wake area) or *restriction* = _13_ (no wake). If it is required to encode cases where the speed limit is known in general or for a certain class(es) of vessel, it must be done using a *Restricted Area*or using other features having the attribute *restriction* (see clause 17 above) and having*restriction* = _27_ (speed restricted), with the speed limit, speed units and, if appropriate, the class of vessel, encoded using an instance of the complex attribute **vessel speed limit**, sub-attributes **speed limit**, *speed units* and *vessel class*. Further detailed information regarding speed limits, for example varying speed limits based on vessel length, draught or cargo, may be encoded, if required, using the complex attribute **information**; or using the attribute *pictorial representation* (for example, to reproduce the graphic for a speed restriction table contained in a Nautical Publication).

If it is required to encode the buoys/beacons marking the *Restricted Area* feature with speed limits, it must be done using *Special Purpose/General Beacon*or *Special Purpose/General Buoy* features (see clauses20.13and 20.5 respectively), with the attribute *category of special purpose mark* = _24_ (reduced wake mark) or _25_ (speed limit mark). The speed limit and its unit of measurement should be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6), sub-attribute *text* (for example _Speed limit is 6 knots_).

[[sec_17.5]]
=== Anchoring restricted (see S-4 – B-431.4)

If it is required to encode a restricted anchoring area, it must be done using a *Restricted Area* feature (see clause17.8), or using other features with the attribute *restriction* (see clause17), where *restriction*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_1_ (anchoring prohibited) or _2_ (anchoring restricted). Additional information about the restriction should be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).

[[sec_17.6]]
=== Areas to be avoided (see S-4 – B-435.7)

If it is required to encode an IMO Area to be Avoided, it must be done using a *Restricted Area* feature (see clause17.8), with attribute *restriction* = _14_ (area to be avoided). An IMO Area to be Avoided around a navigational aid must also be encoded with attribute *category of restricted area* = _12_ (navigational aid safety zone).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Areas other than IMO Area to be Avoided for which entry is prohibited or restricted should be encoded using the **Restricted Area**, having values *restriction* = _7_ (entry prohibited) or _8_ (entry restricted).

[[sec_17.7]]
=== Environmentally Sensitive Sea Areas (see S-4 – B-437)

Environmentally Sensitive Sea Areas (ESSA) should be included on ENCs where there is a specifically identified requirement, and where it is practicable, given the optimum display scale of the ENC data and the extent of the ESSA. If there is no such requirement, or if it is not practicable, details of ESSA should only be inserted in associated publications, such as Sailing Directions. It should be noted that the inclusion of ESSA on smaller optimum display scale of the ENC data may be appropriate for voyage planning purposes.

If it is required to encode an Environmentally Sensitive Sea Area, it must be done using a *Restricted Area* feature (see clause 17.8), with attribute *category of restricted area* = _27_ (ESSA) or _28_ (PSSA).

An Environmentally Sensitive Sea Area that is shown on the source as a point symbol should be encoded using a small surfacerestricted area feature__.__

== Geo Features – Aids to Navigation – Overview

In the context of this Product Specification, the following generic term definitions apply:

*Beacon:* A fixed artificial navigation mark that can be recognised by its shape, colour, pattern, topmark or light character, or a combination of these. It may carry various additional aids to navigation. This term is not commonly used when the navigation mark can be classified as a lighthouse. (IHO Dictionary - S-32).

*Buoy:* A floating object moored to the bottom in a particular (charted) place, as an aid to navigation or for other specific purposes. Navigational buoys may be classified according to: (a) their shape, appearance, or construction, such as barrel, can, cask, conical, cylindrical, dan, keg, nun, pillar, spar, spherical, or topmark buoy; (b) their colour, such as black, chequered, green, red buoy; (c) their location, such as bifurcation, fairway, junction, mid-channel, middle-ground, or turning buoy; (d) the various kinds of hazards or dangers to navigation which they mark, such as bar, isolated danger, fish trap, obstruction, spoil ground, telegraph or wreck buoy; (e) their particular purpose or use, such as anchor, anchorage, compass adjustment, dredging, farewell (or landfall), marker, quarantine, station (or watch), or warping buoy. (IHO Dictionary - S-32).

[[sec_18.1]]
=== Geo features forming parts of navigational aids

Aids to navigation are composed of fixed or floating structure features established specifically as an aid to navigation, which may carry equipment features.

When identifying relationships (associations) between aids to navigation and associated geo features within this document, three "base classes" are used to define the aids to navigation geo features included in the relevant association. These "base classes" are:

* Structure Features: Includes **Cardinal Beacon**, **Cardinal Buoy**, **Daymark**, **Emergency Wreck Marking Buoy**, **Installation Buoy**, **Isolated Danger Beacon**, **Isolated Danger Buoy**, **Lateral Beacon**, **Lateral Buoy**, **Light Float**, **Light Vessel**, **Landmark**, **Pile**, **Safe Water Beacon**, **Safe Water Buoy**, **Special Purpose/General Beacon**, *Special Purpose/General Buoy*.
* Equipment Features: Includes **Daymark**, **Fog Signal**, *Helipad* (exceptionally, see 2^nd^ Remarks bullet below), **Light Air Obstruction**, **Light All Around**, **Light Fog Detector**, **Light Sectored**, **Physical AIS Aid to Navigation**, **Radar Reflector**, **Radar Transponder Beacon**, **Retroreflector**, **Signal Station Traffic**, *Signal Station Warning*.
* Navigational Aid Features: Includes **Cardinal Beacon**, **Cardinal Buoy**, **Daymark**, **Emergency Wreck Marking Buoy**, **Installation Buoy**, **Isolated Danger Beacon**, **Isolated Danger Buoy**, **Lateral Beacon**, **Lateral Buoy**, **Light Float**, **Light Vessel**, **Pile**, **Safe Water Beacon**, **Safe Water Buoy**, **Special Purpose/General Beacon**, *Special Purpose/General Buoy*.

The encoding of relationships between structure and equipment features is described in clause 18.2.

[underline]#Remarks:# Exceptionally,

* Structures that have not been established specifically as an aid to navigation may also carry aids to navigation as equipment features. These include **Bridge**, **Building**, **Cable Overhead**, **Conveyor**, **Crane**, **Dolphin**, **Floating Dock**, **Fortified Structure**, **Fishing Facility**, **Hulk**, **Landmark**, **Offshore Platform**, **Pipeline Overhead**, **Pontoon**, **Pylon/Bridge Support**, **Obstruction**, **Shoreline Construction**, **Silo/Tank**, **Span Fixed**, **Span Opening**, **Wind Turbine**, *Wreck*. If it is required to encode such supporting structures at the same location as an equipment feature, it must be encoded as a separate feature, and share the same spatial type as (for point structures), or cover the location of (for structures of type curve or area) the equipment feature.
* Substantive structures, which may carry helipads, erected in the water and intended to perform the function of light support must be encoded, where required, using the feature *Landmark* (see clauses 7.2 and 25.16). Exceptionally, *Helipad* features may also, if required, be associated to **Building**, *Landmark* or *Offshore Platform* features that do not additionally perform the function of a support for an aid to navigation, using the feature association *Structure/Equipment* (see clause 18.2).
* Topmarks are encoded as part of the navigational aid structure, using the complex attribute *topmark* (see clause 29.34).
* Radar reflectors must not be encoded as separate features when attached to navigational aids. If it is required to encode their existence, it must be done by populating the Boolean attribute *radar conspicuous* = _True_. Radar reflectors may only be encoded where their position is known and they are included as equipment features on an overhead cable structure feature (see clauses 6.10.1, 20.18.1 and 25.15).
* Rescue stations and coast guard stations are not related to navigation, and they must not, therefore, be part of the equipment features of navigational aids. If it is required to encode a rescue or coast guard station at the same location as a navigational mark, it must be encoded as a separate feature, and share the same spatial type as the navigational aid.

Structure Features

**Navigational Aid**

**Structure/Equipment** feature association (see clause 25.16) must be created in order to relate the different features comprising a navigational aid. Where a *Structure/Equipment* feature association is created, there must be only one structure feature related to one or more equipment features. An equipment feature must not be related to more than one structure feature.

[[fig_18-1]]
.Navigational aids – Structure/equipment association
image::figure-18-1.png[]

Note that *Daymark* may be a structure feature or an equipment feature (refer to the lists of structure and equipment features at clause 18.1); where a navigational aid contains a *Daymark* and there is no other base structure (which can serve as the structure feature) indicated on the source, the *Daymark* feature should be encoded as the structure feature. A single *Daymark* feature instance must not be both a structure and an equipment feature.

When the nature of the base structure on land is unknown or there is no structure feature, one of the equipment features may be chosen as the structure feature, giving priority to a *Light All Around* or *Light Sectored* feature, if one exists (however, see also clause 19.1.8). Where this occurs, the light feature must be encoded as the structure feature in the *Structure/Equipment* relationship. Alternatively, a *Pile* feature of type point or a *Special Purpose/General Beacon* feature may be encoded as the structure feature at the same position as the equipment features. When a light is located in the water with no indication on the source of the structure feature, regardless of the height of the light, a *Pile* feature of type surface or a *Special Purpose/General Beacon* feature should be encoded as the structure feature. This will ensure that a symbol will be shown on ECDIS systems when the light features are not displayed during daytime navigation.

image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_36764e87.png["",561,240]

In the above real-world examples, the structure and equipment features that make up the navigational aids are point spatial types, and they mustshare the same geographic point spatial type.

If it is required to encode the name of the navigational aid, it must be done using the complex attribute *feature name* (see clause 2.5.8) on the structure feature. The name must not be repeated for the equipment features. If the name is painted on the structure, it must be encoded with the same spelling in the complex attribute *feature name*. If the name is not based on the Latin alphabet, it must be encoded using *feature name* (*name*), with an appropriate value populated for the sub-attribute **language**, and transliterated for encoding on an iteration of *feature name* (*name*) with an appropriate value populated for the mandatory attribute *language* (normally English (_eng_)).

All point features comprising a navigational aid must share the same geographic point spatial instance.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* For guidance related to the population of the temporal attributes *date end* and *date start* for equipment features in a *Structure/Equipment* association relationship, see clause 2.4.9.

[[sec_18.3]]
=== Buoyage systems and direction of buoyage (see S-4 – B-461)

Systems of buoyage are described as lateral, cardinal, or a combination of lateral and cardinal. Lateral systems depend on a direction of buoyage being defined. The cardinal system depends solely on the main points of the compass. Special purpose buoys often mark the limits or centre of an area (for example an exercise area, a dumping ground) and do not necessarily have lateral or cardinal system characteristics.

The IALA Maritime Buoyage Systemdetails, including the extent of Regions A and B, are given in other publications (for example UK's booklet NP 735 "IALA Maritime Buoyage System"). Although it is called a buoyage system, it applies to all fixed and floating marks except lighthouses, some sector lights, leading lights and marks, major floating lights and lights on offshore structures. Six types of marks are provided by the system: Lateral, Cardinal, Isolated danger, Safe water, Special and Emergency Wreck Marking marks, which may be used in any combination.

[[sec_18.3.1]]
==== Buoyage systems and direction of buoyage (see S-4 – B-461)

The buoyage system of the area covered by the dataset and, where necessary, the direction of buoyage, must be encoded using the Meta features *Navigational System of Marks* and *Local Direction of Buoyage*:

All parts of the dataset containing data must be covered by *Navigational System of Marks* features (see clause 3.6), with the mandatory attribute *marks navigational – system of* indicating the buoyage system in operation. *Navigational System of Marks* features must not overlap.

Within a dataset, there may be some areas where the direction of buoyage is defined by local rules and must, therefore, be specified. These areas should be encoded asseparate*Local Direction of Buoyage* features (see clause 3.7), with the mandatory attribute *orientation value* indicating the direction of buoyage. *Local Direction of Buoyage* features must not overlap, but in areas where local buoyage directions apply, *Local Direction of Buoyage* features must overlap *Navigational System of Marks* features (see Figure 18-3 below).

igure 18-3 – Buoyage system and direction*_

Individual buoys and beacons may not be part of the general buoyage system. This should be encoded using the attribute *marks navigational – system of* on these buoy and beacon features.

[[sec_18.3.1.1]]
===== Encoding IALA marks within IALA A or B

In the following Tables the symbol '/' indicates that this attribute is not relevant for that particular feature class. The Tables contain the most common examples of encoding; other encoding combinations are possible. For encoding of buoys, substitute *Buoy* for *Beacon * in the Feature column. Table 18-3 for topmarks refers to the sub-attribute values for the complex attribute *topmark*.

[[sec_19]]
== Geo Features – Lights

For the purpose of encoding lights in ENC, the following features must be used, depending on the type of light:

* *Light All Around* (see clause 19.2) for lights having the same character over the whole horizon of interest to marine navigation (all-round lights)), excluding fog detector and air obstruction lights;
* *Light Sectored* (see clause 19.3) for lights having one or more sectors which have different characteristics, including directional lights and lights having obscured or partially obscured sectors;
* *Light Fog Detector* (see clause 19.4) for lights used to automatically determine conditions of visibility which warrant the turning on or off of a sound signal; and
* **Light Air Obstruction** (see clause 19.5) for lights marking an obstacle which constitutes a danger to air navigation.

When encoding a light, the combination of the character and purpose of the light must be evaluated in order to determine the most appropriate light feature from the above list.

[[sec_19.1]]
=== Lights: General

[[sec_19.1.1]]
==== Rhythms of lights (see S-4 – B-471.2)

The principal character of a light is its rhythm (although, strictly, fixed lights and some alternating lights are not "rhythmic").

If it is required to encode the rhythms of lights, this must be done using the complex attribute **rhythm of light**, sub-attributes *light characteristic* and *signal group*. When populating **rhythm of light**, the sub-attributes **signal group**, *signal period* and *signal sequence* are only valid for non-fixed lights (that is, sub-attribute *light characteristic* ≠ _1_ (fixed)), with *signal group* and *signal period* being mandatory.

The use of these sub-attributes is defined in the following Table; it contains the most common examples of coding; other coding combinations are possible:

|===

Some lights recently constructed may appear to the Mariner as "fixed and flashing - FFL" by night, while the real-world feature actually comprises two separate lights vertically disposed, one fixed and the other flashing (F&Fl). When it is known that two separate features actually exist, they must be encoded as separate light features, in this case two *Light All Around* features, one with complex attribute **rhythm of light**, sub-attribute *light characteristic* = _1_ (fixed) and the other with *light characteristic* = _2_ (flashing), and not as one *Light**All Around* with *light characteristic* = _13_ (fixed/flash).

[[sec_19.1.2]]
==== Types and functions of lights (see S-4 – B-471.1)

If it is required to encode types and functions of lights, this must be done using the attribute *category of light* (see clause 27.37).

[[sec_19.1.3]]
==== Elevations of lights (see S-4 – B-471.6)

The elevationof a light is the vertical distance between the light source and the plane of reference for heights for the ENC data (see clause 2.5.7).

If it is required to encode the elevation of a light on a fixed structure, it must be done using the attribute *height*.

If it is required to encode the height above the water surface of a light on a floating structure, it must be done using the attribute *vertical length* on the relevant light feature (see clause 2.5.7).

If it is required to encode a night light, it must be done using the attribute *exhibition condition of light*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_4_ (night light) on the light feature.

[[sec_19.1.4.2]]
===== Unwatched lights (see S-4 – B-473.1)

This information should not be encoded, but unwatched (unmanned) lights, with no standby or emergency arrangements, may be encoded using attribute *status*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_17_ (unwatched).

[[sec_19.1.4.3]]
===== Occasional lights (see S-4 – B-473.2)

If it is required to encode an occasional light, it must be done using attribute *status*&nbsp;= _2_ (occasional). If it is required to encode a private light that is not regularly exhibited, it must be done using *status* = _2,8_ (occasional, private).

[[sec_19.1.4.4]]
===== Daytime lights (see S-4 – B-473.4)

If it is required to encode a light shown throughout 24 hours without change of character, it must be done using attribute *exhibition condition of light*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_1_ (light shown without change of character).

If it is required to encode a light having characteristics shown by day different from those shown at night, it must be done by encoding two light features sharing the same point spatial instance:

* one light feature with *exhibition condition of light*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_2_ (daytime light),
* one lightfeature with *exhibition condition of light*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_4_ (night light).

[[sec_19.1.4.5]]
===== Fog lights (see S-4 – B-473.5)

If it is required to encode a light which is exhibited in fog or conditions of reduced visibility, it must be done using a light feature, with attributes *exhibition condition of light*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_3_ (fog light)and *status*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_2_ (occasional)_._

If it is required to encode a light having characteristics shown in fog that are different from those shown in conditions of normal visibility, it must be done by encoding two light features sharing the same point spatial instance:

* one light feature with *exhibition condition of light*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_3_ (fog light) and *status*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_2_ (occasional)
* one light feature with *exhibition condition of light*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_2_ (daytime light) or _4_ (night light) and the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6), sub-attribute *text*&nbsp;= _Character of the light changes in fog_.

Note the distinction between fog lights and fog detector lights, which are lights used to automatically determine conditions of visibility which warrant the turning on or off of a sound signal. Fog detector lights must be encoded, where required, using the feature *Light Fog Detector* (see clause 19.4).

[[sec_19.1.4.6]]
===== Manually-activated lights (see S-4 – B-473.5)

If a light is radio activated, the attribute *signal generation* must be populated with value _5_ (radio activated). To encode the contact information for activation of the light, it must be done using the information type*Contact Details* (see clause24.1). The *Contact Details* must be associated to the light feature using the association *Additional Information*.

If a light is activated by calling into a manned station, the attribute *signal generation* must be populated with value _6_ (call activated). To encode the contact information for the manned station, it must be done using the information type*Contact Details*. The *Contact Details* must be associated to the light feature using the association *Additional Information*.

[[sec_19.1.5]]
==== Leading lights (see S-4 – B-475.6)

If it is required to encode a leading light, it must be done using an appropriate light feature, with attribute:

*category of light*&nbsp; = _4,12_ - front leading light

_4,13_ - rear leading light

_4,14_ - lower leading light

_4,15_ - upper leading light

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Even if, on the source, the leading lights are merged into a single symbol, a light feature must be created for each light. These lights must be placed in their true position; that is, where the source shows a single light with a legend such as __2F.Bu__, further investigation must be done in order to determine the true position of each light, and its full attribution. Compilers should note that where this occurs on paper charts, the position of the light shown on the chart normally corresponds with the rear leading light.
* The leading line must be encoded using the method described in clause 15.1.

[[sec_19.1.6]]
==== Lighthouses (see S-4 – B-457.3)

If it is required to encode a lighthouse, it must be done using a *Landmark* feature (see clause 7.2), with attributes *category of landmark* = _17_ (tower)and *function* = _33_ (light support)for towers, or using a *Building* feature (see clause 6.2), with the attribute *function*&nbsp;=&nbsp;__33__, for any other shapes.

If it is required to encode the attributes **elevation**, *height* and *vertical length* for a lighthouse, this must be done as described in clause 19.1.3.

If the lighthouse is permanently extinguished/unlit, this must be indicated by population of the attribute *status* = _4_ (not in use) for the *Landmark*/**Building**, and the lightfeature must be removed. Where a lighthouse is illuminated by flood lights, the additional value of *status* = _12_ (illuminated) must also be populated. For lights that are temporarily extinguished, see clause 31.2.2 – paragraph 10(i).

[[sec_19.1.8]]
==== Light structures

Light features located in the water must have a structure feature, generally a beacon (for example**Lateral Beacon**, *Special Purpose/General Beacon*) or other fixed structure (for example*Offshore Platform*), or a buoy structure (for example**Lateral Buoy**, *Special Purpose/General Buoy*) for floating aids to navigation. When a light is located in the water with no indication on the source of the structure feature, regardless of the height of the light, a *Pile* feature of type surface or a *Special Purpose/General Beacon* feature should be encoded as the structure feature. This will ensure that a symbol will be shown on ECDIS systems when the light features are not displayed during daytime navigation.

The light portrayal rules for ECDIS result in the display of *Light All Around* features with Boolean attribute *major light* = _True_ using a 360 light sector. On land, if no aid to navigation structure object has been encoded at the position of these lights, the Mariner does not have a displayed centre point to take bearings to:

_*Fimage::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_1d999f3.jpg["",602,315]
 igure 19-1 – Omnidirectional light display in ECDIS*_

Encoders are advised, therefore, that an aid to navigation structure object (for example **Special Purpose/General Beacon**, *Pile*) should be encoded as a light structure object for all *Light All Around* features on land encoded as major lights, where the nature of the structure object is unknown.

[[sec_19.2.1]]
==== All around lights (see S-4 – B-470)

If it is required to encode an all around light (excluding fog detector and air obstruction lights), it must be done using the feature *Light All Around*. This feature must be an equipment feature of a structure feature (see clause 18.2), which may be another light feature at the same position (if it exists and there is no structure feature available), using a *Structure/Equipment* feature association.The IALA Maritime Buoyage Systemrules do not apply for most landfall lights and will apply to minor lights, but not to leading lights, some sector lights or major floating lights. In general, sector lights follow IALA convention when used for marking a channel.Further guidance for encoding various types and characteristics of lights can be found in clauses 19.1.1 to 19.1.7.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* All sector lights, whether single sectored, multi-sectored or having sectors that are deliberately obscured or completely or partially obscured by obstructions, must be encoded, where required, using the feature *Light Sectored* (see clause 19.3); for encoding a directional sector or bearing, see clause 19.3.1.2.
* Fog detector and air obstruction lights must be encoded, where required, using the features *Light Fog Detector* and *Light Air Obstruction* (see clauses 19.4 and 19.5).
* If it is required to encode details of the lighting technology (for example neon), it must be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).

* If it is required to encode the purpose of a marine spotlight, it must be done using the complex attribute*information*.
* Lights on land encoded as major lights (Boolean attribute *major light* = _True_) must have a structure feature encoded (see clause19.1.8) in order for the position of the light to be clearly indicated in the ECDIS.
* The attribute *vertical datum* applies only to **height**; this value must only be encoded if it is different from the value of *vertical datum* encoded on the underlying Meta feature *Vertical Datum of Data* (see clause 3.10).
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the reference datum for the height of the light in tidal waters.
* The attribute *vertical length* only applies to lights attached to floating structures (see clause 2.5.7).
* The indication that a light is a "major" light through the population of the Boolean attribute *major light* with a _True_ value determines the way the light is displayed in ECDIS, and is not based on any legal or formal classification of the importance of lights. Generally, a major light may be considered to be a light intended for use at sea, usually with a range of 15 miles or more, and in outer approaches to harbours. However the determination of what is a major light may be based on a number of additional factors, including the number and characteristics of navigational (and non-navigational) lights in the geographical area, and specific navigational requirements for the area. Indication in a dataset that a light is a major light should be based only on the requirements for ECDIS display, at the discretion of the Producing Authority.
* Names of major lightsare very important. If a light has a name which is unrelated to any other encoded feature, the name must be populated using the complex attribute *feature name* (see clause 2.5.8) on at least the largest optimum display scale ENC data. If the name of a light is obviously that of the named feature on which the light stands, for example Saint Catherine's Point, the name of the light need not be repeated for the light.

[underline]#Distinction:# Cardinal Beacon; Cardinal Buoy; Emergency Wreck Marking Buoy; Installation Buoy; Isolated Danger Beacon; Isolated Danger Buoy; Lateral Beacon; Lateral Buoy; Light Air Obstruction; Light Float; Light Fog Detector; Light Sectored; Light Vessel; Safe Water Beacon; Safe Water Buoy; Special Purpose/General Beacon; Special Purpose/General Buoy.

==== Sectored lights (see S-4 – B-475)

If it is required to encode a light that consists of one or more sectors, it must be done using the feature *Light Sectored*. This feature must be an equipment feature of a structure feature (see clause 18.1), which may be another light feature at the same position (if it exists and there is no structure feature available), using a *Structure/equipment* feature association.The IALA Maritime Buoyage Systemrules do not apply for most landfall lights and will apply to minor lights, but not to leading lights, some sector lights or major floating lights. In general, sector lights follow IALA convention when used for marking a channel.Further guidance for encoding various types and characteristics of lights can be found in clauses 9.1.1 to 9.1.7.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The complex attribute **sector characteristics**, sub-complex attribute *light sector* is used to populate each sector for the light, except for sectors in which there is no light exhibited. Where there is a different rhythm of light between sectors (for example, for complex lights), separate instances of *sector characteristics* must be populated.
* Population of the sub-complex attribute *sector limit* having sub-attributes *sector limit one* = _0_ and *sector limit two* = _360_ (that is, encoding an all around light as a sectored light) is prohibited.
* If a sector of a sectored light is intended to have a directional function, this must be encoded using the *light sector* complex sub-attribute *directional character*. If the light is intensified in this sector, *light sector* sub-attribute *light visibility*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_4_ (intensified) must be populated. The sub-complex attribute *sector limit* is optional for directional light sectors.
* The sub-attribute *sector line length* (see clause 27.158) may be used for critical light sectors to extend the sector line when the ECDIS display settings are set to display default sector lines. The intended usage of the ENC dataset must be considered when determining the usage of *sector line length* so as to avoid excessive screen clutter when default sector display is enabled; and consistent display of light sectors across the entire ENC portfolio should also be a consideration when determining the population of this attribute. Where populated, the value of *sector line length* must not exceed the value populated for the sub-attribute *value of nominal range* for the light sector.
* In some cases the area defined by the intersecting sectors of two discrete sector lights are used to indicate the existence of isolated and sometimes substantial dangers to navigation, the precise position of which may not be known. When default sectors are displayed in ECDIS, the extent and intent of these sectors may not be clearly defined to the Mariner. In order to more clearly indicate these areas, compilers should consider appropriate use of *sector line length* for the relevant sectors in the impacted area. Where it is considered important that the area of possible danger is defined, this should be done by encoding a *Caution Area* feature (see clause 16.10) covering the intersection area. Information relating to the definition of the area by sector lights and a précis of the danger should be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) for the *Caution Area*.
* The fairway defined by the succession of navigable areas in the white sectors of a series of *Light Sectored* features may be encoded using the feature *Fairway* (see clause 15.7).
* If there is additional information required to be encoded that is relevant to all sectors of the light, this must be done using the *information* (see clause 2.4.6). If the additional information is relevant to individual sectors of the light only (for example, for complex (oscillating) light sectors (see clause 19.3.1.3 below)), this must be encoded using the complex sub-attribute *sector information* for the sub-complex attribute *light sector*.
* If it is required to encode details of the lighting technology (for example neon), it must be done using the complex attribute *information*.

* The attribute *vertical datum* applies only to **height**; this value must only be encoded if it is different from the value of *vertical datum* encoded on the underlying Meta feature *Vertical Datum of Data* (see clause 3.10).
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the reference datum for the height of the light in tidal waters.
* Names of major lightsare very important. If a light has a name which is unrelated to any other encoded feature, the name must be populated using the complex attribute *feature name* (see clause 2.5.8) on at least the largest scale optimum display scale ENC data. If the name of a light is obviously that of the named feature on which the light stands, for example Saint Catherine's Point, the name of the light need not be repeated for the light.

===== Lights obscured by obstructions (see S-4 – B-475.3)

image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_7e764576.gif[Shape37,498,198]
__**Figure 19-2 – Obscured light sectors**__If an encoded light is obscured in a part of the navigable area of a sector (see Figure 19-2 (A) above) beyond an offshore obstruction, it must be encoded using **Light Sectored**, with each of the sectors (a) – (c) encoded using the complex attribute *light sector*. The partially obscured sector of (b) must have *light sector* with sub-attributes *light visibility*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_8_ (partially obscured) and sub-attribute *value of nominal range* set to the distance from the light to the obstruction. The sectors in which the light is visible from seaward ((a) and (c)) must be encoded as separate iterations of *light sector*.If there is no navigable water between the light and the obstacle (see (e) in Figure 19-2 (B) above), the masked sector must not have an iteration of *light sector* encoded, unless a faint light is visible in the navigable part of the sector, which should be encoded using **light sector**, with sub-attribute *light visibility*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_3_ (faint). The sectors in which the light is visible from seaward ((d) and (f)) must be encoded as separate iterations of *sector characteristics*.

[[sec_19.3.1.2]]
===== Directional lights (see S-4 – B-475.7-8)

Directional (or direction) lightsof several types are in use but all have in common a very narrow sector intended to mark a direction to be followed. The narrow sector may be flanked by:

* Unlit sectors or unintensified light.
* Sectors of different colour or character.Some direction lights are so precise that a complete colour change at a sector boundary occurs over an angle of less than 1 minute (0∙02°). This corresponds to a lateral distance of just 1 metre at a viewing distance of 3.5 km. In addition the intensity may be maintained right to the edge of the beam, and does not reduce the further the observer is away from the axis.
A moiré effect mark (or variable arrow mark)is a short-range (normally up to 2 km) type of directional "light". Sodium lighting gives a yellow background to a screen (up to 3 m square) on which a vertical black line will be seen by an observer on the centreline, or variable arrow marks when course alteration is needed. The system can be used by day and night. It can also be used as a stop line (seen abeam) for vessels berthing along quays.If it is required to encode a light sector having a directional function, it must be done using the feature *Light Sectored*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The indication that a particular light sector has a directional function is encoded by populating the complex attribute **sector characteristics**, sub-complex attribute *directional character*.
* The mandatory complex sub-attribute *orientation* must only be encoded to indicate the orientation, measured from seaward, of the leading line of the directional light sector when there is no *Recommended Track* or *Navigation Line* feature associated with the directional light. Where the directional sector has an associated *Recommended Track* and/or **Navigation Line**, *orientation* (*orientation value*) for the light sector must be populated with an empty (null) value.
* For a sector indicated as directional, the *light sector* complex sub-complex attribute *sector limit* is optional.
* For moiré effect lights, the Boolean sub-attribute *moiré effect* must be set to _True_.

* If it is required to encode the recommended track and/or navigation line associated with a directional light, it must be done using the methods described in clause 15.1.

[[sec_19.3.1.3]]
===== Oscillating light sectors

Evolving technology in the development of navigational lights has resulted in the installation of complex directional navigation lights with multiple sectors, colours and characteristics, some with oscillating sectors, in many areas where navigation is restricted. These lights may have up to 7 sectors, with the central sector being a very narrow, sometimes intensified, fixed white sector performing the directional function of the light. In the IALA A System, the sectors flanking this directional light may be alternating and oscillate increasingly from white to green (to starboard) and red (to port) with increasing deviation from the track defined by the directional light. These lights will normally be flanked by narrow sectors of fixed green (to starboard) and red (to port). Additionally, there may be outer sectors that are occulting green (to starboard) and red (to port) which oscillate with increasing period of eclipse to isophased or flashing with increasing deviation from the track defined by the directional light. For the IALA B System the colours are reversed. In some cases these complex lights may not conform to IALA. Each of the outer sectors may be very narrow.If is required to encode an oscillating light sector, it should be done using a *Light Sectored* feature, with iterations of the complex attribute *sector characteristics* as follows: For light sectors in the IALA A system that are alternating and oscillate increasingly from white to green (to starboard) and red (to port) with increasing deviation from the track defined by the directional light:*sector characteristics***:** *light characteristic* = _28_ (Alternating); *colour* = _1,3_ (White, Red); **sector limit**; *sector* **information** (*text*) = __White phase decreases as bearing to light increases__**sector characteristics****:** *light characteristic* = _28_ (Alternating); *colour* = _1,4_ (White, Green); **sector limit**; *sector* **information** (*text*) = __White phase increases as bearing to light increases__For lights in the IALA B system that are alternating and oscillate increasingly from white to red (to starboard) and green (to port) with increasing deviation from the track defined by the directional light; transpose the colours red and green in the above encoding.For lights in the IALA A system that are occulting green (to starboard) and red (to port) which oscillate with increasing period of eclipse to isophased or flashing with increasing deviation from the track defined by the directional light:*sector characteristics***:** *light characteristic* = _8_ (Occulting); *colour* = _3_ (Red); **sector limit**; *sector* **information** (*text*) = __Light phase decreases as bearing to light increases__**sector characteristics****:** *light characteristic* = _8_ (Occulting); *colour* = _4_ (Green); **sector limit**; *sector* **information** (*text*) = __Light phase increases as bearing to light increases__For lights in the IALA B system that are occulting red (to starboard) and green (to port) which oscillate with increasing period of eclipse to isophased or flashing with increasing deviation from the track defined by the directional light; transpose the colours red and green in the above encoding.Oscillating lights which are not IALA should be encoded similar to the above. For instance, where a light contains white sectors that are occulting and oscillate with increasing period of eclipse to isophased or flashing with increasing deviation from the track defined by the directional light:For the sector to port of the track defined by the directional light:*sector characteristics***:** *light characteristic* = _8_ (Occulting); *colour* = _1_ (White); **sector limit**; *sector* **information** (*text*) = __Light phase decreases as bearing to light increases__For the sector to starboard of the track defined by the directional light:*sector characteristics***:** *light characteristic* = _8_ (Occulting); *colour* = _1_ (White); **sector limit**; *sector* **information** (*text*) = __Light phase increases as bearing to light increases__All other light sectors must be encoded using additional iterations of **sector characteristics**, with sub-attributes (including *light sector* or *directional character*) populated in accordance with the characteristics of the sector.Distinction: Cardinal Beacon; Cardinal Buoy; Emergency Wreck Marking Buoy; Installation Buoy; Isolated Danger Beacon; Isolated Danger Buoy; Lateral Beacon; Lateral Buoy; Light Air Obstruction; Light All Around; Light Float; Light Fog Detector; Light Vessel; Safe Water Beacon; Safe Water Buoy; Special Purpose/General Beacon; Special Purpose/General Buoy.

==== Air obstruction lights (see S-4 – B-476.2)

If it is required to encode a light marking an obstacle which constitutes a danger to air navigation, which may also be used as a marine navigational aid, it must be done using the feature *Light Air Obstruction*. This feature must be an equipment feature of a structure feature (see clause 18.1) using a *Structure/Equipment* feature association.Further guidance for encoding various types and characteristics of lights can be found in clauses 19.1.1 to 19.1.7.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode details of the lighting technology (for example neon), it must be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).

* The attribute *vertical datum* applies only to **height**; this value must only be encoded if it is different from the value of *vertical datum* encoded on the underlying Meta feature *Vertical Datum of Data* (see clause 3.10).
* Value _13_ (low water) for attribute *vertical datum* is only applicable to enclosed (inland) waterways; and must not be used to indicate the reference datum for the height of the light in tidal waters.

==== Cardinal buoys (see S-4 – B-461.3 and B-467)

Cardinal marksare used in conjunction with the compass to indicate where a Mariner may find best navigable water, taking their name from the quadrant in which they are placed in relation to the point marked. The Mariner should pass N of a North mark, E of an East mark, etc. The shape of cardinal buoys is not significant (although they are usually pillar or spar). To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System (see clause 18.3.1.1), the body has black and yellow bands, configured with black reflecting the points of the topmark cones (for example black above yellow for north). Black double-cone topmarks are an important feature of cardinal marks and are carried wherever practicable. The points are up for a north mark, down for a south mark, apart for an east mark and together for a west mark. Lights (if fitted) are white Q or VQ, uninterrupted for the north, 3 flashes for east, 6 flashes + LFl for south and 9 flashes for west (resembling an analogue clock).If it is required to encode a buoy having the function of a cardinal mark, it must be done using the feature *Cardinal Buoy*.image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_67daba42.png["",517,636]__**Figure 20-2 – IALA cardinal buoys – Characteristics**__Remarks:

==== Isolated danger buoys (see S-4 – B-461.3 and B-467)

Isolated danger buoysare moored above isolated dangers of limited extent with navigable water all around them. The shape of isolated danger buoys is not significant (although they are usually pillar or spar shaped). To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System (see clause 18.3.1.1), the body is black, with one or more red bands. Black double-sphere topmarks are an important feature of isolated danger buoys and carried wherever practicable. The light (if fitted) is white Fl(2).If it is required to encode a buoy having the function of an isolated danger mark, it must be done using the feature *Isolated Danger Buoy*.image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_177836fa.png["",549,263]__**Figure 20-3 – IALA isolated danger buoys – Characteristics**__Remarks:

* If it is required to encode a buoy or topmark that has more than one colour, the attributes *colour* and *colour pattern* must be encoded, according to the rules laid out in clause 2.4.10.
* If it is required to encode the total vertical length, including the topmark and any equipment features (for example light), of the buoy above the water level, it must be done using the attribute *vertical length*.

==== Safe water buoys (see S-4 – B-461.3 and B-467)

Safe water marksare used to indicate there is safe water all around the mark. It may be used as a centre-line, mid-channel or landfall buoy, or to mark the best point of passage under a bridge.To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System (see clause 18.3.1.1), the shape of a safe water buoy is spherical, pillar or spar. The body of the mark has red and white vertical stripes. If the shape of the buoy is not spherical a red spherical topmark is carried wherever practicable.

==== Special purpose/general buoys (see S-4 – B-461.3 and B-467)

Special marksare used to indicate to the Mariner a special area or feature, the nature of which is usually apparent from the ENC, paper chart or associated publication. Special marks may also be used to mark a channel within a channel (for example a Deep Water route), using yellow buoys of the appropriate lateral shape, or yellow spherical buoys to mark the centreline. A special buoy may be any shape but must not conflict with lateral or safe water marks (for example an outfall buoy on the port-side of a channel could be can but should not be conical). To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System (see clause 18.3.1.1), the body of the buoy is yellow. The topmark (if fitted) is a yellow diagonal 'X' (St Andrew's cross). Lights (if fitted) are yellow and of any rhythm except those used for cardinal, isolated danger and safe water marks.If it is required to encode a buoy having the function of a special purpose mark, or a buoy whose appearance or purpose is inadequately known, it must be done using the feature *Special Purpose/General Buoy*.In the following Table, a blank indicates that the encoder may choose a relevant value for the attribute. The Table contains the most common examples of coding; other coding combinations are possible for *Special Purpose/General Buoy* features.

==== Installation buoys (see S-4 – B-445.4)

Although the oil and gas from some fields are sent ashore by submarine pipeline, a variety of mooring systems have been developed for use in deep water and in the vicinity of certain ports, to allow the loading of large vessels and the permanent mooring of floating storage vessels or units. These offshore systems include large mooring buoys, designed for mooring vessels up to 500,000 tonnes, and platforms on structures fixed at their lower ends to the seafloor. They allow a vessel to moor forward or aft to them, and to swing to the wind or stream, and are termed installation buoys.If it is required to encode an installation buoy, it must be done using the feature *Installation Buoy*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode a buoy that has more than one colour, the attributes *colour* and *colour pattern* must be encoded, according to the rules laid out in clause 2.4.10.

==== Mooring buoys (see S-4 – B-431.5)

Mooring buoys must be shown on charts of appropriate scale to indicate buoys and moored vessels as possible hazards to navigation as well as, on the largest scales, to facilitate mooring operations.If it is required to encode a mooring buoy, it must be done using the feature *Mooring* **Buoy**.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode a buoy that has more than one colour, the attributes *colour* and *colour pattern* must be encoded, according to the rules laid out in clause 2.4.10.
* If it is required to encode the total vertical length, including any equipment features (for example light), of the buoy above the water level, it must be done using the attribute *vertical length*.
* If it is required to encode a visitors mooring, it must be done by populating the attribute *visitors mooring* as _True_.

==== Lateral Beacons (see S-4 – B-461.3 and B-467)

Lateral beaconsare generally used for well defined channels, in conjunction with a direction of buoyage. They indicate the port and starboard sides of the route to be followed.To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System (see clause 18.3.1.1), port handbeacons have a can shaped topmark. The colour of port hand beacons, topmarks and lights (if fitted) will be red in IALA region A and green in IALA region B.To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System, starboard hand beacons have a conical shaped topmark. The colour of starboard hand beacons, topmarks and lights (if fitted) will be green in IALA region A and red in IALA region B.A preferred channel beaconis a modified lateral beacon, with horizontal colour bands. The predominant colour indicates which side is the preferred channel, the other colour indicates the secondary channel. If fitted, the light is Fl(2+1), the colour indicating the preferred channel.If it is required to encode a beacon having the function of a lateral mark, it must be done using the feature *Lateral Beacon*.image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_50e03b92.png["",544,466]__**Figure 20-5 – IALA lateral beacons – Characteristics**__Remarks:

* If it is required to encode a beacon or topmark that has more than one colour, the attributes *colour* and *colour pattern* must be encoded, according to the rules laid out in clause 2.4.10.
* For guidance on the encoding of the attributes **elevation**, *height* and *vertical length* see clause 2.5.7. *elevation* applies only to beacons on land. Values populated for *height* and *vertical length* must include the topmark and any equipment features.
* If it is required to encode a cairn that bears the colour(s) specified by a navigational system of marks, it must be done using a beacon feature.

==== Cardinal beacons (see S-4 – B-461.3 and B-467)

Cardinal marksare used in conjunction with the compass to indicate where a Mariner may find best navigable water, taking their name from the quadrant in which they are placed in relation to the point marked. The Mariner should pass N of a North mark, E of an East mark, etc. To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System (see clause 18.3.1.1), the body of the beacon has black and yellow bands, configured with black reflecting the points of the topmark cones (for example black above yellow for north). Black double-cone topmarks are an important feature of cardinal marks and are carried wherever practicable. The points are up for a north mark, down for a south mark, apart for an east mark and together for a west mark. Lights (if fitted) are white Q or VQ, uninterrupted for the north, 3 flashes for east, 6 flashes + LFl for south and 9 flashes for west (resembling an analogue clock).If it is required to encode a beacon having the function of a cardinal mark, it must be done using the feature *Cardinal Beacon*.image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_67daba42.png["",508,624]__**Figure 20-6 – IALA cardinal beacons – Characteristics**__Remarks:

==== Isolated danger beacons (see S-4 – B-461.3 and B-467)

Isolated danger beaconsare placed on isolated dangers of limited extent with navigable water all around them. To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System (see clause 18.3.1.1), the body of an isolated danger beacon is black, with one or more red bands. Black double-sphere topmarks are an important feature of isolated danger beacons and carried wherever practicable. The light (if fitted) is white Fl(2).If it is required to encode a beacon having the function of an isolated danger mark, it must be done using the feature *Isolated Danger Beacon*.image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_177836fa.png["",549,263]__**Figure 20-7 – IALA isolated danger beacons – Characteristics**__Remarks:

* If it is required to encode a beacon or topmark that has more than one colour, the attributes *colour* and *colour pattern* must be encoded, according to the rules laid out in clause 2.4.10.
* For guidance on the encoding of the attributes **elevation**, *height* and *vertical length* see clause 2.5.7. *elevation* applies only to beacons on land. Values populated for *height* and *vertical length* must include the topmark and any equipment features.
* If it is required to encode a cairn that bears the colour(s) specified by a navigational system of marks, it must be done using a beacon feature.

Safe water marksare used to indicate there is safe water all around the mark. It may be used as a centre-line, mid-channel or landfall beacon, or to mark the best point of passage under a bridge. To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System (see clause 18.3.1.1), the body of the mark has red and white vertical stripes. A red spherical topmark is an important feature and carried wherever practicable.

==== Special purpose/general beacons (see S-4 – B-461.3 and B-467)

Special beaconsare used to indicate to the Mariner a special area or feature, the nature of which is usually apparent from the chart or associated publication. To conform to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System (see clause 18.3.1.1), the body of the beacon is yellow. The topmark (if fitted) is a yellow diagonal 'X' (St Andrew's cross). Lights (if fitted) are yellow and of any rhythm except those used for cardinal, isolated danger and safe water marks.If it is required to encode a beacon having the function of a special purpose mark, or a beacon whose appearance or purpose is inadequately known, it must be done using the feature *Special Purpose/General Beacon*.In the following Table, a blank indicates that the encoder may choose a relevant value for the attribute. The Table contains the most common examples of coding; other coding combinations are possible.

__**Table 20-2 – IALA special purpose beacons – Common types**__Remarks:

* Non-beacon structures (for example chimneys, masts, towers) that are also used to serve the purpose of a special purpose beacon must be encoded, where required, using the feature *Landmark* (see clause 7.2).
* If it is required to encode a beacon or topmark that has more than one colour, the attributes *colour* and *colour pattern* must be encoded, according to the rules laid out in clause 2.4.10.
* For guidance on the encoding of the attributes **elevation**, *height* and *vertical length* see clause 2.5.7. *elevation* applies only to beacons on land. Values populated for *height* and *vertical length* must include the topmark and any equipment features.
* If a special purpose beacon does not conform to the system of navigational marks defined by *Navigational System of Marks* (see clause 3.6), the attribute *marks navigational – system of* on the *Special Purpose/General Beacon* should be populated as _9_ (no system).
* If it is required to encode a cairn that bears the colour(s) specified by a navigational system of marks, it must be done using a beacon feature.

[[sec_20.13.2]]
==== Signs and notice boards

If it is required to encode a fixed or floating sign or notice board, it must be done using a *Special Purpose/General Beacon* feature or *Special Purpose/General Buoy* feature (see clause 20.5), with attribute *category of special purpose mark* = _18_ (notice mark), or using the feature *Daymark* (see clause 20.14).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode a sign or notice board that has more than one colour, the attributes *colour* and *colour pattern* must be used, according to the rules laid out in clause 2.4.10.
* If it is required to encode any text shown on a notice board or sign, it must be done using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).
* If it is required to encode the shape and colour of a notice board, it must be done by encoding the board as a *Daymark* feature.

On those structures that do not by themselves present an adequate viewing area to be seen at the required distance, the aid is made more visible by affixing a daymark to the structure.

Major floating lightsare generally classed as those with a nominal range in excess of 10 nautical miles. Special circumstances, for example an isolated location, may mean that a floating light of lower range is given this status. The structure on which the light is fixed will be a light vessel, a major light float or a LANBY (Large Automatic Navigational Buoy, which is a type of superbuoy).If it is required to encode a light vessel, it must be done using the feature *Light Vessel*.

==== Fog signals (see S-4 – B-451-454)

The term "fog signal" refers to the sound emitted, not the apparatus. Fog signals are short range aids to navigation, principally used as hazard warnings. For various reasons they are unreliable as indicators of position. Their importance relative to other aids to navigation has declined but they are still considered useful for the safe navigation of vessels with very limited (or non-functioning) electronic equipment. A fog signal should be shown on ENCs at an optimum display scale on which vessels may navigate within range.The positionfrom which a fog signal is emitted is usually on a buoy, or close enough to a light to be treated as sounded from the same position as the light.If it is required to encode a fog signal, it must be done using the feature *Fog Signal*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The characteristic rhythm of fog signals (other than those actuated by waves, which are irregular) may be more important than their type when Mariners are attempting to identify them. The number of sound emissions (for example blasts, strokes) and the period must therefore be encoded, where known, using the attributes **signal group**, *signal period* and *signal sequence*.
* Where required, the attribute *signal frequency* must be quoted in Hertz, for example a signal frequency of 950 MHz must be encoded as _950000000_.
* If the fog signal is radio activated, the attribute *signal generation* must be populated with value _5_ (radio activated). To encode the contact information for activation of the signal, it must be done using the information type*Contact Details* (see clause24.1). The *Contact Details* must be associated to the *Fog Signal* feature using the association *Additional Information*.
* If the fog signal is activated by calling into a manned station, the attribute *signal generation* must be populated with value _6_ (call activated). To encode the contact information for the manned station, it must be done using the information type*Contact Details*. The *Contact Details* must be associated to the *Fog Signal* feature using the association *Additional Information*.
Distinction:Signal Station Warning.

=== Automatic Identification System (AIS) aids to navigation (see S-4 – B-480-484)

AIS signals used as an aid to navigation may:

* actually be transmitted from a physical aid to navigation, or appear to be transmitted from a physical aid to navigation but is actually transmitted from an AIS base station (Physical AIS aid to navigation); or
* be transmitted from an AIS base station to represent an aid to navigation where a physical aid to navigation does not exist (Virtual AIS aid to navigation).

It is not required to encode AIS information on ENCs, as ENCs are intended to be used in conjunction with ECDIS as part of an Integrated Navigation System (INS), in which AIS targets are displayed when in range. However, Producing Authorities may wish to indicate the presence of a physical or virtual AIS aid to navigation to aid in the route planning process or for use in ECS or other navigation systems.

If it is required to encode a physical AIS aid to navigation, it must be done using the feature *Physical AIS Aid to Navigation*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Physical AIS aids to navigation must be encoded, where required, using the geometry of the physical aid to navigation from which the AIS signal is, or appears to be, transmitted. If it is required to encode the actual location from which the signal is transmitted for a physical AIS aid to navigation where the signal is transmitted from another location, it must be done using a *Radio Station* feature (see clause 21.4), with attribute *category of radio station* = _16_ (AIS base station).
* The unique Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) code for the physical AIS aid to navigation should be encoded, where known, using the attribute *MMSI code*.
* Where populated, the attribute *estimated range of transmission* for *Physical AIS Aid to Navigation* provides the Mariner with an approximate distance from the position of the aid that the broadcast signal will generate the display of the AIS symbol on the ECDIS.

[[sec_21.4.1]]
==== Radio stations (see S-4 – B-480-484)

Transmissions from radio stations may provide Mariners with a line of position. Most radio position fixing systems require Radio Direction Finding (RDF) equipment to determine the bearing of the transmitting device; such equipment is generally no longer fitted on vessels. The exception is "emergency use only" VHF-based direction finding services (which do not use RDF equipment). Consequently, the following radio position-fixing stations are now obsolete and there is no longer any value in encoding them on ENCs:

* Circular (non-directional) (RC), directional (RD) and rotating pattern (RW) marine radiobeacons;
* Consol beacons (Consol);
* Aeronautical radiobeacons (Aero RC);
* Radio direction-finding stations (except VHF-based emergency stations) (RG);
* Coast Radio Stations providing 'QTG' service (R).
The feature "radio station" is used to encode the point of transmission of the signal.If it is required to encode a radio station, it must be done using the feature *Radio Station*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The *Radio Station* must only be used to encode the technical equipment itself, independent of the building or structure in which it is installed. If it is required to encode the building or structure (for example mast, tower, radar dome), it must be done using an appropriate feature (for example **Building**, *Landmark*). There is no requirement to establish a Structure/Equipment association between the *Radio Station* feature and the structure in which it is installed.
* Further information (for example transmission characteristic) may be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).
* Each VHF-channel should be indicated, using the attribute *communication channel* (see clause 27.77). Alternately, if the same VHF-channel(s) apply to multiple features in the dataset, this should be indicated through an associated instance of the information type **Contact Details**, attribute *communication channel* (see clause 24.1).
* If it is required to encode a DGPS station, it must be done using **Radio Station**, with attribute *category of radio station* = _10_ (Differential GNSS).
* Where required, the complex attribute **frequency pair**, sub-attributes *frequency shore station receives* and **frequency shore station transmits**, must be quoted in Hertz, for example a signal frequency of 950 MHz must be encoded as _950000000_.

[[sec_21.4.2]]
==== Radio direction-finding stations (see S-4 – B-483)

If it is required to encode a radio direction-finding station, it must be done using a *Radio Station*feature, with attribute *category of radio station*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_5_ (radio direction-finding station). The identification signal may be encoded using the attribute *call sign*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Direction–finding is now only provided as an emergency service by VHF.

==== Radar beacons (see S-4 – B-486)

Radar beacons are transmitters operating in the marine radar frequency band. The signals produce a characteristic line on a vessel's radar display enabling the Mariner to determine their position with greater certainty than would be possible by means of a normal radar display alone.If it is required to encode a radar beacon, it must be done using the feature *Radar Transponder Beacon*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The *Radar Transponder Beacon* must only be used to encode the technical equipment itself, independent of the building or structure in which it is installed. If it is required to encode the building or structure (for example mast, tower, radar dome), it must be done using an appropriate feature (for example**Building**, *Landmark*).
* The attribute *signal group* is used to encode Morse identification letter(s) for the radar beacon, where known.
* Leading raconsare established such that, when their bearing lines are coincident on a vessel's radar display, the bearing serves to indicate the track to be followed. If it is required to encode the bearing line and the recommended track for leading racons, it must be done as described in clause 15.1. Where the bearing line coincides with a leading line defined by lights or other visual features making up a range system, navigation lines and recommended tracks must not be duplicated. The features making up the range system should be associated with a feature *Range System* (see clause 15.6) using the association *Range System Aggregation* (see clause 25.13). NOTE: All features comprising a range system must have the same value populated for the attribute *scale minimum* (see clause2.5.9).
* If, for some reason, the radar transponder beacon signal is obscured between certain bearings, this information should be encoded using the complex attribute *sector limit* to encode the "visible" sector, as for lights (see clause 19.3.1.1).
* The sweep period may be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).
Distinction:Radar Line; Radar Range; Radar Station.

==== Pilot boarding places (see S-4 – B-491.1-2)

For a pilot boarding place, the pilot vessel may either cruise in the area or come out on request. Off some large ports pilots on outgoing ships may be disembarked at a different location. Pilots may board from a helicopter; it is then less important for a ship to reach the exact position of the boarding place but an approximate position should still be encoded. Some pilot stations are used solely for long-distance (deep-sea) pilots. Pilots may be in constant attendance, in regular attendance at certain limited times, or available by previous arrangement only. The primary purpose of encoded pilotage information is to show the position of the facility. Because of the many variations in the service provided, the main source of information on pilotage must be in an associated publication or product.If it is required to encode a pilot boarding place, it must be done using the feature *Pilot Boarding Place*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode the ship to shore or shore to ship contact information, this should be done using the attribute *communication channel*. Alternately, if the same VHF-channel(s) apply to multiple features in the dataset, this should be indicated through an associated instance of the information type **Contact Details**, attribute *communication channel* (see clause 24.1).
* If it is required to encode the area in which pilotage regulations apply, it should be done using the feature *Pilotage District* (see clause 16.26). The relationship between the pilotage district and any associated pilot boarding places should be encoded using the feature association *Pilotage District Association* (see clause 25.11).

[[sec_22.1.2]]
==== Pilot stations ashore (see S-4 – B-491.4)

If it is required to encode a pilot station ashore, it must be done using a *Building* or *Landmark* feature, with attribute *function*&nbsp;=&nbsp;_11_ (pilot office) or _12_ (pilot lookout).Distinction: Pilotage District.

==== Coast Guard stations (see S-4 – B-492)

The organisation of coast-watching and rescue services differs from country to country. For charting purposes it is assumed that two distinct functions can be recognised, even though they may be parts of the same organisation co-ordinating and effecting life saving and performing other services. Coast Guard stations are stations at which a watch is kept either continuously, or at certain times only. They are sited so as to have a commanding view, are often associated with signal stations, and are visually prominent. They are also referred to as watch-keeping stations.Coast Guard stationsare located along the coasts of most maritime nations. Their primary purpose in former days was to enforce customs regulations, observe the movements of ships and to watch for signs of distress at sea. These functions are largely superseded by modern telecommunications and Search & Rescue (SAR) arrangements, coordinated by regional Maritime Rescue and Coordination Centres (MRCC).If it is required to encode a Coast Guard station, it must be done using the feature *Coast Guard Station*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Many modern Coast Guard services no longer maintain visual watch from fixed stations. However, because stations were usually situated so as to have a commanding view and may therefore be visually prominent and make good fixing marks, the buildings may still be encoded as *Building* or *Landmark*.
* The *Coast Guard Station* must only be used to describe the function of the Coast Guard station, independent of the building or structure itself. If it is required to encode the building or structure in which the Coast Guard station operates, it must be done using an appropriate feature (for example **Building**,*Landmark*).
* Maritime Rescue and Coordination Centres (MRCC) are part of a constantly manned communications watch system. If it is required to encode a MRCC, it should be done using **Coast Guard Station**, with the Boolean attribute *is MRCC* = _True_. The name of the station may be populated using the complex attribute *feature name* (sub-attribute *name*), for example _MRCC Swansea_.
* Each VHF-channel should be indicated, using the attribute *communication channel* (see clause 27.77). Alternately, if the same VHF-channel(s) apply to multiple features in the dataset, this should be indicated through an associated instance of the information type **Contact Details**, attribute *communication channel* (see clause 24.1).

==== Warning signal stations (see S-4 – B-494; B-496-7)

Signal stationscommunicating visually have declined in importance. They are encoded on the largest optimum display scale ENC data not only for their main role of signalling information and instructions but also as a form of landmark. The signals generally exhibit lights by day and night but may display shapes or flags by day.If it is required to encode a warning signal station, it must be done using the feature *Signal Station Warning*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The *Signal Station Warning* must only be used to describe the function of the signal station, independent of the building or structure itself.

==== Traffic signal stations (see S-4 – B-494-5)

Signal stationscommunicating visually have declined in importance. They are encoded on the largest optimum display scale ENC data not only for their main role of signalling information and instructions but also as a form of landmark. The signals generally exhibit lights by day and night but may display shapes or flags by day.The nature of traffic signals varies from country to country and even from port to port. For charting purposes traffic signals can be considered to include, for instance:

* Port entry and departure signals;
* Lock, docking and berthing signals;
* Bridge signals;
* International traffic signals.
If it is required to encode a traffic signal station, it must be done using the feature *Signal Station Traffic*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode a bridge light marking the centre of a navigable span, it must be done using a light feature (see Section 19).
* The *Signal Station Traffic* must only be used to describe the function of the signal station, independent of the building or structure itself. If it is required to encode the building or structure housing the service, it must be done using an appropriate feature (for example **Building**, *Landmark*).
* Each VHF-channel should be indicated, using the attribute *communication channel* (see clause 27.77). Alternately, if the same VHF-channel(s) apply to multiple features in the dataset, this should be indicated through an associated instance of the information type **Contact Details**, attribute *communication channel* (see clause 24.1).

==== Rescue station (see S-4 – B-490 and B-493)

The organisation of coast-watching and rescue services differs from country to country. For charting purposes it is assumed that these two distinct functions can be recognised individually, even though they may be parts of the same organisation co-ordinating and effecting life saving and performing other services.Rescue stations are the places at which life saving equipment is held, especially lifeboats (usually in relatively sheltered positions, near sea level). Rescue stations are not necessarily visually prominent. The range of equipment used in rescue is wide, for example search and rescue helicopters; fast, long-distance lifeboats; inflatable inshore lifeboats.If it is required to encode a rescue station, it must be done using the feature *Rescue Station*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The *Rescue Station* must only be used to describe the function of the rescue station, independent of the building or structure itself. If it is required to encode the building or structure housing the service, it must be done using an appropriate feature (for example **Building**, *Landmark*).
* If it is required to encode a refuge beacon, it must be done using a *Special Purpose/General Beacon* feature, with attribute *category of special purpose mark* = _44_ (refuge beacon), not by using *Rescue Station*.
* Each VHF-channel should be indicated, using the attribute *communication channel* (see clause 27.77). Alternately, if the same VHF-channel(s) apply to multiple features in the dataset, this should be indicated through an associated instance of the information type **Contact Details**, attribute *communication channel* (see clause 24.1).

If it is required to encode a harbour facility, it must be done using the feature *Harbour Facility*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Fishing harbours or portsare equipped to provide for the particular needs of fishing boats. Boat harbours and marinasare areas of sheltered water, generally within harbours or ports, set aside for the use of small craft, usually with moorings, buoys, and, in the case of marinas, berthing facilities.
* Depending on the navigational purpose, harbour facilities are defined by: an area including docks, basins, infrastructure such as buildings, and dockside equipment; or a point.
* If it is required to encode a terminal with facilities to load/unload or store shipping containers, this should be done using *Harbour Facility* with attribute *category of harbour facility* = _10_ (container terminal).
* If it is required to encode a covered structure into which ships can go, this must be done using the feature *Structure Over Navigable Water* (see clause 8.7). These structures may be part of the larger harbour facility, which should be encoded as *Harbour Facility*.
* Each VHF-channel should be indicated using the attribute *communication channel* (see clause 27.77). Alternately, if the same VHF-channel(s) apply to multiple features in the dataset, this should be indicated through an associated instance of the information type **Contact Details**, attribute *communication channel* (see clause24.1).

==== Text placement

If it is required to place text on an ENC to improve clarity and readability of display, it must be done using the cartographic feature *Text Placement*. In navigationally relevant areas such as shipping channels and dredged areas, where default ECDIS text positioning may cover other features, Data Producers should consider using *Text Placement*. The *Text Placement* feature must be associated with the relevant geo feature using the composition *Text Association* (see clause 25.17).NOTE: Where an associated instance of *Text Placement* has not been related to a feature having the attribute *name* and/or the attributes associated with the characteristics of a feature populated, the text will be positioned in the ECDIS display in accordance with the default position for text strings defined in the Portrayal Catalogue.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The *Text Placement* cartographic feature is used by the ECDIS to optionally position text in ECDIS, which has been populated using an attribute(s) for the associated feature. The attribute(s) is identified by populating the mandatory attribute *text type*.
* Where two instances of *text type* are populated for a *Text Placement* instance, the feature name and characteristics as derived from the target feature attribution will be vertically aligned in the ECDIS display in accordance with the defined text offset bearing and distance. If it is required to position the feature name and the feature characteristics independently, this must be done by associating two instances of **Text Placement**, one having *text type* = _1_ (name) and the other having *text type* = _2_ (feature characteristic), to the target feature. Note, however, that independent vertical or horizontal alignment of both the name and the characteristic of a feature is not recommended, as the text will overlap as the Mariner zooms to smaller scales than the optimum display scale for the data.
* The attributes *text offset bearing* and *text offset distance* define the bearing (related to true north) and distance of the anchor point of the text, in millimetres in the ECDIS display, to be displayed from the associated feature. The values populated for these attributes must be determined based on the desired position of the text at the optimum display scale of the ENC data. Note that the attribute *text offset bearing* does not rotate the text itself, but determines the alignment of the anchor point (or justification) for the text location (horizontal (left, centred or right) and vertical (bottom, centre or top)) based on the encoded bearing. Displayed text will always appear horizontal regardless of the display mode set by the mariner (north-up or course-up), unless the Boolean attribute *text rotation* is set to _True_.
* The Boolean attribute **text rotation**, when populated as __True__, will rotate the text on the ECDIS display to align along the bearing populated for the attribute *text offset bearing*.
* Data Producers are advised to determine the best positioning for text at the optimum display scale for the data; and based on "north-up" ECDIS display. While **text offset bearing**, *text offset distance* and *text rotation* will position the text at the same location relative to the associated feature at all Mariner's Selected Viewing Scales, Data Producers are advised that, as the Mariner zooms out to smaller viewing scales, text may unintentionally cover other charted detail. Therefore, as an alternative, Data Producers may experiment with positioning the text so that it clears the majority of other charted features at the smallest scale at which the text is intended to be displayed, and populating the attribute *scale minimum* accordingly (see bullet below). Data Producers are also advised that optimum results may not be achieved when the Mariner has set the display setting for the ECDIS to screen rotations other than "north-up". Encoders should also consider the positioning of the name of a feature where the name is encoded in multiple languages, as the name displayed may be of varying character length based on the Mariner's language settings (see clause 2.5.8).
* The attribute *scale minimum* may be used to determine a scale at which the text string is no longer visible in the ECDIS when scale minimum functionality is enabled. Where populated, the value for *scale minimum* on *Text Placement* must not be set to a smaller scale value than the value populated for the associated feature.
* S-101 portrayal for *Text Placement* has been developed to take into account the name of a light support structure feature where included in the association *Structure/Equipment* as follows:

** Where *Text Placement* containing attribute *text type* = _1_ (name) is associated to the equipment feature and the name has been encoded only on the structure feature, the *Text Placement* inherits the name from the structure.
** Where *Text Placement* containing attribute *text type* = _1_ (name) is associated to the equipment feature and the name has been encoded on the equipment feature, the *Text Placement* takes the name from the equipment feature. If a name has also been included on the structure feature, this will not be considered in this case, however a separate *Text Placement* associated to the structure may be encoded to place the name of the structure feature at a desired position, if required.
** Where *Text Placement* containing attribute *text type* = _2_ (feature characteristic) is associated to the equipment feature, the characteristics of the structure feature will not be considered.
* *Text Placement* should normally be associated with features of type point, but may be used for features of type curve and surface.

* The complex attribute **time intervals by day of week**, sub-attribute *day of week is range* indicates whether an instance of *time intervals by day of week* encodes a range of days or discrete days. The day(s) or day range(s) are encoded using sub-attribute *day of week*. Where *day of week is range* is populated as __True__, there must be exactly two instances of the attribute *day of week*. If *day of week* is not populated, this indicates that the same schedule applies every day (Monday through Sunday). Multiple ranges or mixing range with discrete days(s) is not allowed (if this is required another instance of *time intervals by day of week* must be encoded). See clause 2.4.9.
* Overlapping intervals bound to the same feature using the association *Additional Information* are not permitted.

==== Nautical information

If it is required to encode identical information associated with multiple geo features which cannot be encoded using the descriptive attributes on those features, it should be done using the information type*Nautical Information*. Each instance of *Nautical Information* must be associated to the feature(s) to which the information applies using the association *Additional Information* (see clause 25.1).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Within a dataset, individual instances of information associated with a geo feature which cannot be encoded using the descriptive attributes on the feature should be encoded using the attributes *information* or *pictorial representation* on the feature itself, not using *Nautical Information*. However where this information is shared between features contained in a single dataset, or included in multiple datasets within the ENC portfolio, *Nautical Information* may be used.
* *Nautical Information* must not be used to include a reference to a picture file (attribute *pictorial representation*) to a feature that does not itself include *pictorial representation* as an allowable attribute.
* The complex attributes *fixed date range* and **periodic date range**, when populated for **Nautical Information**, apply only to *Nautical* **Information** and not to any feature that it may be associated with.

==== Spatial quality

Spatial attribute types must contain a referenced geometry and may be associated with spatial quality attributes. Each spatial attribute instance must be referenced by a feature instance or another spatial attribute instance. Spatial quality attributes are carried in the information type*Spatial Quality*. Only point, multipoint and curve geometry and the Meta feature *Quality of Bathymetric Data*can be associated with spatial quality. Currently no use case for associating surface geometry with spatial quality attributes is known, therefore this is prohibited. Vertical uncertainty is prohibited for curves as this dimension is not supported by curves. Each instance of *Spatial Quality* must be associated to the geometry to which the information applies using the association *Spatial Association* (see clause25.15); or in the case of *Spatial Quality* associated with **Quality of Bathymetric Data**, using the association *Quality of Bathymetric Data Composition* (see clause 25.12).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The sub-complex attributes *horizontal position uncertainty* and *vertical uncertainty* must be encoded using either *Spatial Quality* or the Meta feature *Quality of Bathymetric Data* (see clause 3.8) to provide the spatial accuracy components for provision of an overall indication of the quality of bathymetric data for an area. The decision as to which option to use should be based on whether the horizontal position and vertical uncertainty values are specific to a single *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature or relate to multiple *Quality of Bathymetric Data* features. In general, specific values are related to areas of changeable bathymetry over time or varying bathymetric data quality in the water column (as shown in Figure 3-2 in clause 3.8.1); and common values are specific to general quality uncertainty values in non-changeable areas. It is prohibited to use both options for a single *Quality of Bathymetric Data* instance.
* The complex attribute *spatial accuracy*is used to specify the vertical and horizontal position uncertainty, which may degrade in changeable areas over time. In order to provide the spatial accuracy components for provision of an overall indication of the quality of bathymetric data for an area, an instance of *Spatial Quality* may be associated with one or more instances of *Quality of Bathymetric Data*using the association *Quality of Bathymetric Data Composition* (see clauses 3.8 and 25.12); or encoded using the complex attribute *zone of confidence* on the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* itself. Where the attribute *category of temporal variation* for the associated *Quality of Bathymetric Data* is set to values _2_ (likely to change and significant shoaling expected) or _3_ (likely to change but significant shoaling not expected) and the spatial accuracy is encoded using **Spatial Quality**, multiple instances of *spatial accuracy* should be encoded to provide an indication of the degradation of the vertical and horizontal position accuracy of the charted bathymetric information over time. Where multiple instances of *spatial quality* are encoded, these must correspond to the number of instances and values (including the zone of confidence categories and date ranges) populated for the complex attribute *zone of confidence* on the associated *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature.

** The sub-complex attribute *fixed date range* is used, where required, to define the date range(s) where the spatial accuracy is degraded over time. Where multiple date ranges are specified, the attributes *date start* and *date end* for each instance of *fixed date range* must be equal to the corresponding instances of *zone of confidence* (*fixed date range*) for the associated *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature (see clause 3.8).
** The sub-complex attribute **vertical uncertainty**, where encoded, is used to specify the vertical uncertainty of the depths covered by the associated *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature within a specified date range (where encoded); and should be adjusted to indicate the degradation of the vertical uncertainty over time where multiple instances of *zone of confidence* are encoded (see above). When *depth range minimum value* is specified for the associated *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature, *vertical uncertainty* refers only to the uncertainty of the swept depth defined by *depth range minimum value*.
** The sub-complex attribute **horizontal position uncertainty**, where encoded, is used to specify the positional uncertainty of the depths covered by the associated *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature within a specified date range (where encoded); and should be adjusted to indicate the degradation of the horizontal position uncertainty over time where multiple instances of *zone of confidence* are encoded (see above).
** The sub-attribute *quality of horizontal measurement* must not be populated for *Spatial Quality* associated to *Quality of Bathymetric Data*.
* For the geometry associated with **Obstruction**, **Sounding**,*Underwater/Awash Rock* and *Wreck* features, an instance of *Spatial Quality* using the association *Spatial Association* (see clause 25.15) may be associated to indicate, where required, that the horizontal position and/or the vertical uncertainty for the associated feature is of different (higher or lower) accuracy than indicated by the underlying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* Meta feature. Where *Spatial Quality* is associated to **Obstruction**, *Underwater/Awash Rock* or *Wreck* and attribute *height* or*value of sounding* is populated with an empty (null) value, the value for the attribute *vertical uncertainty* (*uncertainty fixed*) on the associated **Spatial Quality**, where required, must also be populated as empty (null). See also clause3.8.1.3(Sounding uncertainty).
* The attribute *quality of horizontal measurement* may be used on *Spatial Quality* to provide an indication of lower accuracy quality of depth features, in addition to population of **horizontal position accuracy**, than the underlying *Quality of Bathymetric Data* indicates, however where this is done the *Spatial Quality* feature must not be associated to a *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature.

== Association Names

The following diagrams are examples to demonstrate the structure of the feature/feature and feature/information association tables included in the following clauses, as they may be correspondingly represented in UML. The examples are taken from the UML Relationship Diagram for the feature *Two Way Route Part*. The complete relationship diagram is shown in Figure 25-1 below.

[[fig_25-1]]
.Two-Way Route Part UML relationship diagram
image::S-101_Annex_A_DCEG_Ed_2.0.0_Final_Clean_html_ce7a4ff2.png["",602,324]

NOTE: The association *Spatial Association* (see clause 25.15) is not included in Figure 25-1 above, as this association identifies the relationship between an information type (*Spatial Quality*) and the spatial type to which a feature is bound (that is, the geometry to which the feature is bound, rather than the feature itself).

The tables included in this Section are structured such that each row of the table shows all components of the relationship as they would be included at the association end for the entries included in the "Associated With" column. For example, for the *Two Way Route* end of the *Two-Way Route Aggregation* association (indicated by the red outline included in Figure 25-1 above), the "Role Type" is __Aggregation__; the "Role" is __The Collection__; and the "Multiplicity" is _0,1_ (see clause 25.19):

[cols="68,90,383,69"]
|===
.<h| Role Type .<h| Role h| Associated With .<h| Multiplicity
| Aggregation | The Collection | *Two-Way Route* | 0,1

|===

Within the tables, features are grouped in separate table entries where the features included at either end of the relationship may differ for the association. For example Figure 25-2\* below shows that, for the feature/information association **Additional Information**, the feature *Anchor Berth* may be associated with any of the information types **Contact Details**, **Non-Standard Working Day**, *Service Hours* or **Nautical Information**; while the feature *Two Way Route Part* may only be associated with the information type *Nautical Information* (as shown in Figure 25-1 above and Figure 25-5).

In Figure 25-3 above, the table should be interpreted as follows:

* A *Two-Way Route* instance, if it exists, _aggregates_ (or is the container for)_the collection_ of one or more *Two-Way Route Part* features.
* A *Two-Way Route Part* instance is _the_ __component__ (or is a containee) of a *Two-Way Route* feature, if the *Two-Way Route Aggregation* association is created.
* The _1,*_ multiplicity at the *Two-Way Route Part* end of the relationship indicates that, where a *Two-Way Route Aggregation* exists, there must be to at least one *Two-Way Route Part* feature included in the *Two-Way Route Aggregation*. NOTE: This does not mean that all encoded instances of *Two-Way Route Part* must be included in a *Two-Way Route Aggregation* (see next bullet).
* The _0,1_ multiplicity at the *Two-Way Route* end of the relationship indicates that there is no requirement to bind each *Two-Way Route Part* feature to an instance of *Two-Way Route* using a *Two-Way Route Aggregation* (due to the lower multiplicity being zero). However, where the relationship exists, there must be exactly one *Two-Way Route* feature included in the association.

Figure 25-4 below shows the representation of the feature/feature association *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* for the *Two-Way Route Part* feature (see clause 25.19).

|===

The components of the feature/feature association *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* should be interpreted as for the corresponding components of the feature/feature association *Two-Way Route Aggregation* described for Figure 25-3, except for the multiplicity at the *Two-Way Route Part* end of the association (indicated with the arrow in Figure 25-4). The multiplicity as indicated in the UML as "0..\* {1..\* [C]}" in this case is an example of "collective multiplicity" notation. Collective multiplicities are described in the following clauses in the Remarks section of the tables.

* A collective multiplicity can only exist when there is more than one feature type that may be used in a given role. A collective multiplicity indicates the multiplicity of the collection.
* The "0..*" component of the multiplicity shown in the UML in this example is the "individual multiplicity". An individual multiplicity indicates the multiplicity for each component of the collection, and in this example indicates that that none of the listed features are required to be included.
* The collective component of the multiplicity ({1..\* [C]} in the UML) indicates that where the association *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* exists, there must be at least one of any of the features (collectively) that may be included as "containees". The allowable list of features is included in the following table entries, noting in this example that at least one instance of *Two-Way Route Part* is allowable, if required, for the *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* (as highlighted in Figure 25-4).
* The individual component of the multiplicity (0,*) indicates there is no requirement for a *Two-Way Route Part* feature (or any other feature in the list) to be included in a *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* (due to the lower multiplicity being zero). However where the relationship exists, there may be an unlimited number of *Two-Way Route Part* features or any other feature included in the list (due to the upper multiplicity being "*").
* Upright style (non-italicized) features in the tables are members of the collective multiplicity, italicized features are not. The individual multiplicity applies to all listed features; the collective multiplicity only applies to the upright features, which may or may not comprise the entire list.

The Tables in this Section show only the individual multiplicity in the "Multiplicity" column. The indication of collective multiplicity is included in the Remarks (in Figure 25-4 above, the Remark "A *Traffic Separation Scheme Aggregation* must, if required, include at least one of any of the features shown in the "The Component" role below in upright text associated to a *Traffic Separation Scheme* feature" indicates the collective multiplicity).

The only additional characteristic to note in Figure 25-5, which is characteristic of all feature/information associations, is that unlike feature/feature associations, feature/information associations have only one role (at the information feature end of the relationship).

Each row included in Figure 25-6 above describes a S-101 association instance that may be created and include one or more instances of the feature type *Lateral Buoy* as a member; and is structured such that all components of the association are grouped as they would appear at the end of the association containing *Lateral Buoy* (see Figure 25-1 and associated guidance).

. The name of the association as specified in the following clauses.
. The list of features that *Lateral Buoy* may be associated to for the association (in UML terms, the list of features at the "other end" of the association).
. The type of association as defined for the *Lateral Buoy* end of the association – "Association", "Aggregation" or "Composition" as described in S-100 Part 1, clause 1-4.9; and included in the tables in this Section in the "Role Type" column. NOTE: The association type for a feature/information association will always be "Association".
. The role name as defined for the *Lateral Buoy* end of the association and as described in Section 26; and included in the tables in this Section in the "Role" column. NOTE: a dash "-" in this column indicates the one-way nature of a feature/information association – the role name is included at the information end of the association only.
. The multiplicity as defined for the *Lateral Buoy* end of the association and included in the tables in this Section in the "Multiplicity" column. For **Lateral Buoy**, these multiplicities are interpreted as follows:

* 0,1 for the *Structure/Equipment* association means that a *Lateral Buoy* can exist in isolation (lower multiplicity 0) but, if the association exists, exactly one instance of *Lateral Buoy* must be included in the "The Structure" role of type Composition. The same principle applies for the *Text Association* association.
* 0,\* means that a *Lateral Buoy* can exist in isolation (lower multiplicity 0) but, if the association exists, one or more instances of *Lateral Buoy* may (but are not required) to be included in the association. In general this is an indication of "collective multiplicity" (see Figure 15-4 above and associated guidance).

**To decide on a ZOC Category, all conditions outlined in columns 2 to 4 of the Table must be met.**Explanatory notes quoted in the Table:^1 ^ The allocation of a Zone of Confidence (ZOC) indicates that particular data meets minimum criteria for position and depth accuracy and seafloor coverage defined in this Table. ZOC categories reflect a charting standard and not just a hydrographic survey standard. Depth and position accuracies specified for each ZOC category refer to the errors of the final depicted soundings and include not only survey errors but also other errors introduced in the chart production process. Data is further qualified in Meta Feature Type *Quality of Bathymetric Data* (see clause 3.8) and associated Information Type *Spatial Quality* (see clause 24.5) attributes as follows:a) Positional Accuracy (*horizontal position uncertainty*) and Sounding Accuracy (*vertical uncertainty*) on the associated instance of *Spatial Quality* may be used to indicate that a higher position or depth accuracy has been achieved than defined in this Table (for example a survey where full seafloor coverage was not achieved could not be classified higher that ZOC B; however, if the position accuracy was, for instance, ± 15 metres, the attribute *horizontal position uncertainty* could be used to indicate this).b) Swept areas where the clearance depth is accurately known but the actual seabed depth is not accurately known may be accorded a 'higher' ZOC (that is, A1 or A2) providing positional and depth accuracies of the swept depth meets the criteria in this Table. In this instance, the attribute *depth range minimum value* on the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature may be used to specify the swept depth. The position accuracy criteria apply to the boundaries of swept areas.c) The complex attribute *survey date range* on the *Quality of Bathymetric Data* feature is used to indicate the start and end dates of the survey(s) covering the area.^2^ Position Accuracy of depicted soundings at 95% CI (2.45 sigma) with respect to the given datum. It is the cumulative error and includes survey, transformation and digitizing errors etc. Position accuracy need not be rigorously computed for ZOCs B, C and D but may be estimated based on type of equipment, calibration regime, historical accuracy etc.^3^ Depth accuracy of depicted soundings = a + (b~*~d)/100 at 95% CI (2.00 sigma), where d = depth in metres at the critical depth. Depth accuracy need not be rigorously computed for ZOCs B, C and D but may be estimated based on type of equipment, calibration regime, historical accuracy etc.^4 ^ Significant seafloor features are defined as those rising above depicted depths by more than:DepthSignificant Featurea. <40 m 2 mb. >40 m 10% depthA full seafloor search indicates that a systematic survey was conducted using detection systems, depth measurement systems, procedures, and trained personnel designed to detect and measure depths on significant seafloor features. Significant features are included on the chart as scale allows. It is impossible to guarantee that no significant feature could remain undetected, and significant features may have become present in the area since the time of the survey.^5 ^ Typical Survey Characteristics – these descriptions should be seen as indicative examples only.^6^ Controlled, systematic surveys (ZOC A1, A2 and B) – surveys comprising planned survey lines, on a geodetic datum that can be transformed to WGS 84.^7^ Modern survey echo sounder – high precision single beam depth measuring equipment, generally including all survey echo sounders designed post 1970.

=== scale minimum (SCAMIN)

.<a| IHO Definition: *SCALE MINIMUM*. The minimum scale at which the feature may be used for example for ECDIS presentation.Attribute Type: IntegerIndication: The modulus of the scale is indicated, that is 1:89 999 is encoded as 89999.Unit: NoneMinimum range: 999Maximum range: 19999999Range closure: Closed interval (_minimum ≤_ _*scale minimum*_ _≤ maximum_)Example: If a particular minimum scale is specified as 1:89 999 (encoded as *89999*), and an example of a smaller scale would be 1:179 999 (encoded as *179999*).The *scale minimum* value of a feature determines the display scale below which the feature is no longer displayed. Its purpose is to reduce clutter, to prioritise the display of features and to improve display speed. In encoding its value, the producing authority should consider these factors, as well as the scale at which the feature is no longer likely to be required for navigation. In order to optimize the performance and clarity of the ENC, it is a mandatory requirement on ENCs that *scale minimum* is used.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* *scale minimum* only affects the display of a feature on an ECDIS, not its presence in the Electronic Navigational Data Service (ENDS).
* If *scale minimum* is not encoded, the feature is displayed at all scales.
* Where *scale minimum* is used, it must always be set to a scale less (that is, to a smaller scale) than the optimum display scale of the data as described in clause 2.5.5. Failure to follow this rule will mean that features will not be displayed on the ECDIS until the overscale indication is activated. See clause 2.5.9, Table 2-6, for the list of mandatory *scale minimum* values.
* Skin of the Earth and Meta features must always be displayed. Therefore, *scale minimum* must not be encoded on Skin of the Earth and Meta features.
* If the same feature exists in datasets of different optimum display scales, the same *scale minimum* value must be assigned to each occurrence of the feature.

* The attribute *default* *clearance depth* must be populated with a value, which must not be an empty (null) value, only if the attribute *value of sounding* for the feature instance is populated with an empty (null) value and the attribute **height**, if an allowable attribute for the feature, is not populated.
* The value for *default clearance depth* is determined from the attribute *depth range minimum value* for the surrounding encoded *Depth Area*(s) or *Dredged Area* (see clauses 11.4 and 11.7) in accordance with the Tables below. For an area feature covered by more than one depth area, the *default clearance depth* is determined based on the *depth range minimum**value* of the shoalest of the depth areas covering the feature.
* The auto-populated value for *default clearance depth* may be amended by the Data Producer if the resulting isolated danger indication in the ECDIS is not considered appropriate (if, for example, it is known that vessels having a draught deeper than 20.1 metres are able to navigate safely in the area; or if the Data Producer wishes to indicate that only vessels to a specified draught that is less than 20 metres may navigate safely in the area).
* A drying height is indicated by a negative value.
The following Tables provide an indication for the values (if relevant) to be populated for the attribute *default clearance depth*. The Tables have been partitioned such that the top section has the precondition that the target feature (**Obstruction**, *Underwater/Awash Rock* or *Wreck*) is completely covered by *Depth Area* and/or *Dredged Area* feature(s) having a known value for the attribute **depth range minimum value**; and the bottom section has the precondition that the target feature is of unknown depth (attribute *value of sounding* = Unknown) and is completely or partially covered by an *Unsurveyed Area* feature, or a *Depth Area* and/or *Dredged Area* feature having an unknown value for the attribute *depth range minimum value*. In the Tables:

* The symbol "/" indicates that this attribute is not relevant for the feature instance and therefore is not present. Where "/" appears in the *default clearance depth* column, the attribute must not be populated.
* A blank indicates that the attribute may have any allowable value, including an unknown (empty (null)) value. For non-mandatory attributes, a blank also indicates that the attribute may not be present.
* Where attribute values are quoted:

** Enumerate values separated by commas indicate that any one of the listed values may be populated;
**"Known" means that the attribute is mandatory and has been populated with a value;
**"Unknown" means that the attribute is mandatory and is therefore present, but has not been populated with a value;
**"Empty (null)" means that the attribute is not mandatory, but is present and has no value. For the purposes of these Tables, "Empty (null)" also equates to the non-mandatory attribute not being present for the feature instance.
**"Least Depth" in the *default clearance depth* column is related to the underlying Skin of the Earth depth feature(s) where the value for attribute *depth range minimum value* for the covering *Depth Area* and/or *Dredged Area* feature(s) is known, and is determined as follows:

*** For features of geometric primitive point covered by a *Depth Area* or *Dredged Area* feature; or for features of geometric primitive curve or surface covered by a single *Depth Area* or *Dredged Area* feature, the value of the attribute *depth range minimum value* for the *Depth Area* or *Dredged Area*.
*** For features of geometric primitive curve or surface covered by multiple *Depth Area* and/or *Dredged Area* features, the shoalest value of the attribute *depth range minimum value* for the *Depth Area*/*Dredged Area* features.

== Updating (see S-4 – B-600)

[underline]#Remarks:#

* An ENC Update will be rejected by the ECDIS if it is located outside the area of data coverage for the dataset (that is, area covered by the Meta feature *Data Coverage* with attribute *category of coverage* = _1_ (coverage available)) or if it changes the extent of this area. Where the area of data coverage for a base ENC dataset is to be changed, this must be done by issuing a New Edition of the dataset.
* It has been reported that some ECDIS experience problems in loading large Update datasets. Therefore, as a guide, ENC Updates should not exceed 50 Kilobytes in size.
* It has been reported that grouping new or modified soundings into existing sounding groups (see clause 11.3) in an ENC Update negatively impacts the discovery of the changes to the bathymetry by Mariners. Therefore, encoders are advised that soundings added or modified as part of an ENC Update should be encoded as individual sounding objects or, if in close proximity, may be included as a single grouped sounding object. When a New Edition of the ENC is produced, soundings may be re-grouped in accordance with the Data Producer's standard practices.
* When updating the geometry of curve features, compilers must note S-101 clause X.X regarding the requirement for the vector records making up the curve feature to be referenced sequentially. Additionally, for curve features comprising multiple edges, the end node of a vector record must be the same as the start node of the following vector record. It has been reported that some ECDIS reject ENC Updates where the geometry does not conform to these requirements.

[[sec_31.1]]
=== Issuing Updates in advance

Under certain conditions, it may be necessary for a Data Producer to issue Update information in advance. For example, a change in a traffic routeing system must be made public before the new situation is implemented. Within an Update dataset there is no means of indicating the date at which an Update must be applied. Therefore, when an Update dataset is received by an end-user, it must be applied immediately. To avoid situations where Update information would cause target data to reflect a situation that does not yet exist, the following encoding rules must be followed:

a) If the advance Update information contained in the Update message involves the addition of features to the existing data (for example a new lighthouse), the *date start* sub-attribute for the complex attribute *fixed* **date range** on the new features must contain the date at which the Update becomes active.

b) If the advance Update information contained in the Update message involves the modification of existing features (for example a change in a traffic routeing system), it must be treated as a deletion of the existing features and replacement with new features. See a) above and c) below.

c) If the advance Update information contained in the Update message involves the deletion of existing features (for example the removal of a buoy), the Update message must set the *end date* sub-attribute for the complex attribute *fixed* **date range** of all features to be deleted to the date at which the Update becomes active. *NB*. This Update message does not actually delete the features from the dataset, it simply indicates that on the date held in the *date end* sub-attribute for the complex attribute *fixed* **date range** they become obsolete. A further Update to actually delete the obsolete features from the dataset should be sent at the time that the change in the real world occurs.

d) To highlight to the Mariner that the advance Update information contained in an Update message will take place in the future, it is recommended that a *Caution Area* feature (see clause 16.10) be created covering the location at which the future changes will take place. A warning note specifying, in plain language, the nature of the future change should be encoded, using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6). The sub-attribute *date end* for the complex attribute *fixed* **date range** on the *Caution Area* must be set to the date at which the change described in the Update becomes active.

Changes to the *date start* and *date end* for *fixed* **date range** cannot be applied to spatial types. Therefore, a change to the geometry of a real world feature (for example the relocation of a buoy) to be applied in the future can only be achieved by updating all of the geo and spatial types involved.

As a consequence of issuing advance information Updates, more than one instance of a particular real world feature could exist in the dataset.

Further information regarding issuing Update information in advance as an equivalent to the paper chart Preliminary Notices to Mariners process can be found at clause 31.2.3.

[[sec_31.1.1]]
==== Advance notification of changes to traffic separation schemes

It is important that Mariners be provided with advance notification of changes to traffic separation schemes (TSS), which may include modification to an existing TSS, addition of a new TSS or removal of a TSS. In order to provide a consistent approach to Mariners regarding advance notification of changes to a traffic separation scheme, the following procedure should be adopted:

1) At least one month before the changes to the TSS come into force, issue an updated dataset (as an Update or a New Edition) which:

* Adds new or amended TSS component features. These features must have *date start* for *fixed* **date range** populated with the date that the changes to the TSS come into force.
* Adds *date end* for *fixed* **date range** (populated with the date of the day before the changes to the TSS come into force) to any component features of the existing TSS that are to be changed or deleted.
* Creates a *Caution Area* surface feature (see clause 16.10) covering the geographic extent of both the current and the future TSS. The complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6) must be used to explain the change to the TSS, for example_"The traffic separation scheme off Cape Bon is to be modified at 0000 UTC on 1 July 2009. This ENC includes all the information before and after the change, indicated by the sub-attributes_ __**date end**__ _(before the change) and_ __**date start**__ _(after the change) for the complex attribute_ __**fixed** __ __**date range**__ _on the components of the scheme"_. The sub-attribute *date end* on *fixed* **date range** for the *Caution Area* should be populated with the date at which the change comes into force or, if encoders wish to provide extended information to the Mariner that a change has been made, with a date up to a month after the change comes into force. If the current and the future TSS are not in the same geographic area, it may be required to encode two distinct *Caution Area* surface features. A picture file may be referenced by the *Caution Area* using the attribute *pictorial representation* if it is considered useful, for example the equivalent paper chart representation of the amended or new TSS.

2) As soon as possible after the modified/new/deleted TSS comes into force, issue an updated dataset (as an Update or New Edition) which:

* Deletes the changed or redundant component features of the former TSS.
* Removes the attribute *fixed date range* from the component features of the new TSS.

3) The *Caution Area* must also be removed by Update, either as part of the Update to remove the redundant component features of the former TSS, or as a separate Update at a later date, corresponding to the date populated in the sub-attribute *date end* for the complex attribute *fixed* **date range** for the *Caution Area*.

Encoders who are members of RENCs should also provide advance notification of changes to TSS to their RENC in accordance with RENC procedures, in order for the RENC to provide additional notification to Mariners of impending TSS changes.

=== Guidelines for encoding Temporary and Preliminary ENC Updates

[[sec_31.2.1]]
==== Introduction

The following provides high level guidance for the promulgation of the equivalent of paper chart Temporary (T) and Preliminary (P) Notices to Mariners (NMs) via ENC Updates. This guidance allows for some latitude in its application and is dependent on the assessment of each particular case, and as such relies ultimately on the judgement of each ENC Producing Authority.

[[sec_31.2.2]]
==== Temporary (T) Notices to Mariners (see S-4 – B-633)

. Temporary Notices to Mariners, (T)NMs, for paper charts are defined in S-4, Section B-600. A (T)NM promulgates navigationally significant information that will remain valid only for a limited period of time.

For the paper chart, the convention is for the Mariner to insert the Update on the chart in pencil, and erase it when the (T)NM is cancelled.

S-101 provides mechanisms which allow ENCs to be automatically updated. This allows the affected ENC(s) to be continually updated in a timely manner for the duration of the NM without additional workload for the Mariner.

Producing Authorities must promulgate temporary information which is safety-related or which otherwise needs to be advised to the Mariner urgently by ENC Update to provide the ECDIS user with an updated System Database. This service corresponds to the service that (T)NMs offer to the paper chart user.

[start=2]
. Update encoding for an ENC and (T)NM for the paper chart are two completely different communication processes for promulgating information to the Mariner. Since these processes are different (but not supposed to be independent), and the products to which they apply are also different, it is recommended that ENC Updates be derived from the source information rather than the paper chart (T)NM. Often the (T)NM for paper chart does not provide enough detail to apply the relevant ENC Update.
. If possible the information should be encoded with the relevant features. However, HOs should consider the following:

* An ENC Update must not be initiated if the information will no longer be valid by the time it is received by the Mariner; this will depend upon the timescales relating to the Producer Nation's ENC Updating regime. Shorter time periods may be covered by Radio Navigational Warnings (RNW). If known, the ENC Update should include an indication of how long the temporary change will remain in force.

* If it is unlikely that the HO will be notified when a temporary change will revert to its original charted state, the HO should consider an alternative method such as a general note or by issuing an ENC Update explaining, for example, that the aids to navigation within an area are reported to be unreliable.

It is important that HOs should consider constraints of time when identifying the encoding method. Time consuming and unnecessarily complex methods of encoding should be avoided.

[start=4]
.. The overuse of *Caution Area* features (especially *Caution Area* of type surface – see clause 16.10) for temporary information should be avoided. The *Caution Area* feature is used when it is relevant for the situation and/or when a particular change needs a special warning. *Caution Area* may be used when the relevant features cannot be encoded, for example information cannot be displayed clearly or cannot be easily promulgated due to time constraints.
.. To correctly encode an ENC Update the source information is essential in determining which elements of the Update are reliable, which are permanent and which are temporary. The attribute *status* with value _7_ (temporary) should only be used in an Update when it is certain that the status of a feature is confirmed as temporary.
.. Use of complex attribute *fixed* **date range**:

The earliest date on which a feature will be present (*date start*) and the latest date on which a feature will be present (*date end*) must only be encoded when known. Where such dates have been encoded for any feature that is the structure component of a *Structure/Equipment* feature association, all other component features within the relationship must not extend beyond the temporal attribute values encoded for the structure feature.

The ENC Update should be issued as close as possible to the earliest date of the change (*date start*), unless it is appropriate to provide the information well in advance. A feature no longer present should be removed from the display by issuing a further Update as soon as possible after the return to the original charted state (*date end*). The timing of the issue of these Updates will depend upon the Producing Authorities ENC Updating regime and its corresponding timescales.

When an ENC Update promulgates information well in advance and uses *fixed* **date range**, a *Caution Area* feature may be used in order to inform Mariners that temporal information exists at some future point in time.

[start=4]
.. The complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6), sub-attribute *text* should be used as required to provide supplementary or contextual information when encoding temporary (or preliminary) information. When the text is too long to be encoded using *information* (*text*) (see clause 27.177), the complex attribute **information**, sub-attribute *file reference* should be used to encode a reference to an ENC support file. Encoders using *information* to provide positional information must express the coordinate values in WGS 84 and in accordance with S-4 – B-131. If it is deemed necessary a picture file (referenced using attribute *pictorial representation*) may be included.
.. ENC Updates issued for temporary information should be carefully managed and reviewed regularly to consider whether further action is necessary. New information may have been received that necessitates the issuing of a new Update to modify or cancel the previous one. Producing Authorities should make it easy to recover the original charted state before the temporary changes came into effect.
.. Further verification is recommended to make sure that the encoded ENC Update is consistent with the corresponding paper chart Notice to Mariners.
.. Guidelines for typical cases:

[type=a]
. Individual new physical features (for example wreck, buoy) with no associated explicit or implicit area associated (for example restricted area):

* Encode the relevant S-101 feature.
* In this instance a *Caution Area* feature would not normally be used.

[start=2,type=a]
.. Individual new physical feature(s) with an associated explicit area around it:

*** Encode the relevant S-101 surface feature (for example *Restricted Area*). The relevant feature is encoded for the new physical feature. However, when the area is an "entry prohibited area" or a *Caution Area* feature the new physical feature(s) may be omitted to simplify encoding unless it is navigationally significant.
.. Individual new physical feature with a notification of caution, for example "Mariners are advised to navigate with caution…":

* Encode the relevant S-101 feature. Additional clarification and advice may, if required, be provided using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6). Exceptionally, a *Caution Area* feature may be encoded to highlight the caution if considered necessary.

[start=4,type=a]
. Obstructions (including wrecks) reported to exist within an area:

** Encode an *Obstruction* or *Wreck* feature of type surface (see clauses 13.6 and 13.5).
. New simple surface feature (military practice area, dredged area):

* Encode the relevant S-101 surface feature.
* Supplementary information is provided using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6).
* Normally, a *Caution Area* feature is not added.

[start=6,type=a]
.. Complex information within an area (for example works in progress where the changes are numerous or involve complex changes to the topology):

*** Encode the surface feature. It should be encoded with the relevant S-101 feature or, if more suitable or by default, a *Caution Area* feature (see clause 16.10). Supplementary or contextual information is provided using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6). When the available information is sufficiently detailed, navigationally significant features (for example navigational aids, obstructions) should be encoded or modified within the area. When the available information does not permit this, a *Caution Area* feature defining the area is preferred.
.. Changes to an existing feature (for example navigational aid):

* In these instances it is usually only necessary to change the attributes values. A *Caution Area* feature (see clause 16.10) may be used to warn the Mariner if it is considered necessary.

[start=8,type=a]
.. Buoy temporarily moved:

*** When a buoy is temporarily moved then it, and any associated features, are "moved" to the new position and the attribute *status* = _7_ (temporary) is populated. Alternative encodings are possible, for example, if the move is for a fixed period of time. In these cases the feature, and any associated components, can be created in the temporary position with sub-attribute *date end* for the complex attribute *fixed* **date range** populated with the date corresponding to the end of the fixed period of time. The currently charted feature, and any associated components, should have *date start* for the complex attribute *fixed* **date range** also populated with the date corresponding to the end of the fixed period of time. A *Caution Area* feature may, if considered necessary, be added.
.. Light temporarily extinguished:

* The attribute *status* for the *Light* feature is populated with the values _11_ (extinguished) and _7_ (temporary).

[start=10,type=a]
.. Change to a maintained depth in a dredged area:

*** When information is received from an official or recognised survey authority relating to a dredged area where the dredged depth has changed, the attribute value of *depth range minimum value* for the *Dredged Area* feature should be changed to the value provided by the survey.
*** Where a *Sounding* feature is encoded in a dredged area to indicate shoaler depths, the&nbsp;attribute value&nbsp;*exposition of sounding* = _2_ (shoaler than the depth of the surrounding depth area) should not be&nbsp;populated (see clauses 11.3.1 and 11.4.1). Where required,&nbsp;the shoal depths should be encoded using **Sounding**,&nbsp;with the appropriate underlying depth information (*Depth Contour* and *Depth Area*) to support the depths. Alternatively, the attribute *depth range maximum value* for the *Dredged Area* may be set to the designed dredged depth for the dredged area and the attribute *depth range minimum value* set to the value of the shoalest depth, or a *Caution Area* feature may be encoded covering the shoaler depth area with the depth information provided using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6). Where the shoal depths are close to the edge of the dredged area, the dredged area limit may be adjusted to exclude the shoal depths from the area. See also S-4 – B-414.5.

[[sec_31.2.3]]
==== Preliminary (P) Notices to Mariners (see S-4 – B-634)

. Preliminary Notices to Mariners, (P)NMs, for paper chart are defined in S-4, Section B-600. A (P)NM promulgates navigationally significant information early to the Mariner, for example when a paper chart new edition cannot be issued in due time.

For the paper chart, the convention is for the Mariner to insert the Update on the chart in pencil, and erase it when the (P)NM is cancelled.

S-101 provides mechanisms which allow ENCs to be automatically updated (Update application profile). This allows the affected ENC(s) to be continually updated in a timely manner for the duration of the NM without additional workload for the Mariner.

Producing Authorities must promulgate preliminary information which is safety-related or which otherwise needs to be advised to the Mariner urgently by ENC Update to provide the ECDIS user with an updated System Database. This method of delivery corresponds to the service that (P)NMs offer to the paper chart user.

[start=2]
. Update encoding for ENC and (P)NM for paper chart are two completely different communication processes for promulgating information to the Mariner.

For example, there are instances when the paper chart needs updating using a NM block (also known as a chartlet or patch) or by issuing a New Edition due to the complexity or volume of changes. This could clutter the paper chart unacceptably if amended by hand and/or overburden the chart corrector. The lead time for a NM block correction or a New Edition can be lengthy, sometimes several months. In these cases a (P)NM may be issued as an interim measure. The ENC Updating mechanisms are more flexible and may allow for ENC Updates to be issued in quicker time. However, experience has shown that large Updates may result in processing issues in the ECDIS, in particular inordinately long loading times. Therefore producing an ENC New Edition may be the better option in some cases.

There may be other instances, when new information is received, where it is not possible to fully update both the ENC and paper chart promptly. For example, not all the information required to produce a chart-updating NM is received by the HO in the first notification (for instance notification of works in progress or projected), or extensive new information requires significant compilation work. In these cases it is still necessary to provide notification of navigationally significant changes to the Mariner in a timely manner.

Since the paper chart and ENC processes are different (but not supposed to be independent), and also the products to which they apply are different, it is recommended that ENC Updates be derived from the source information rather than from the paper chart (P)NM. It is often the case that the paper chart (P)NM does not provide enough detail to encode the ENC Update exactly as it should be.

[start=3]
. Simple or more complex encoding methods are possible but it is important for Producing Authorities to consider carefully which encoding method is appropriate when creating an ENC Update with due consideration for time.
. Often, information received is too complex, extensive and/or imprecise to be encoded with the relevant S-101 features. In these instances the use of a *Caution Area* feature (see clause 16.10) is preferred to give a précis of the overall changes together with detailed navigationally significant information. For complex or extensive changes the *Caution Area* should have the complex attribute **information**,sub-attribute *file reference* referencing a file containing precise details of the preliminary information. See also clause 31.2.2 paragraph 7 above. If the information is less precise then *information* should be used to inform Mariners of this fact.

It is noted that the Mariner, if it is considered necessary, has the facility in the ECDIS to add "Mariner Objects" and annotate them. These can be saved in the System Database based on information provided in textual form using the *information* complex attribute. It is envisaged that these features would be created at the "Route Planning" stage and act as a prompt during the "Route Monitoring" phase.

When information is issued as advance notification for an ENC it is necessary to provide as soon as possible to the Mariner the final and full charted information encoded with the relevant S-101 features. An ENC Update or a New Edition of the ENC dataset should therefore be issued at a later date when the Producing Authority can carry out full encoding of the changes. The period of time will depend on the following:

* the time needed by the HO to undertake the full encoding with relevant features;
* the time needed to obtain confirmation of details; and
* the date at which the real world situation is stabilized and any forecast changes have been completed.

[start=5]
. Source Information received may contain some navigationally significant elements that are simple to encode with the relevant features in a timely manner. In such cases these elements may be encoded with the relevant features provided that they reflect the "real world" situation after the ENC Update is made available to the user. However, if the changes are subject to continual change these features should be amended as a consequence and will represent additional work for the HO. In such cases, the ENC Update should also warn the Mariner that the situation is subject to change. For temporary information, see clause 31.2.2.
. Use of complex attribute *fixed* **date range**: See clause 31.2.2 paragraph 6. For new or amended routeing measures, see clause 31.1.1.
. Use the complex attribute *information*: See clause 31.2.2 paragraph 7.
. Diagrams are sometimes very useful to the Mariner, for example, for indicating changes to complex routeing measures or the introduction of new ones. A picture file may be referenced using the attribute *pictorial representation* in such cases.
. ENC Updates issued for preliminary information should be managed and reviewed regularly. For example further source information may have been acquired requiring a further ENC Update. This may add, modify or cancel information previously promulgated.
. Further verification is recommended to make sure that the encoded ENC Update is consistent with the corresponding paper notice.
. Guidelines for typical cases:

[type=a]
. Traffic separation schemes:

** See clause 31.1.1. For the use of the complex attribute *fixed* **date range**, see also clause 31.2.2 paragraph 6.
. Complex information within an area of change (for example works in progress):

* A *Caution Area* feature (see clause 16.10) should be created to cover the area. Information is provided using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6), sub-attribute **text**, for example __under construction__, or sub-attribute *file reference*to encode a reference to an ENC support file when it is necessary to give more detailed information. If sufficiently detailed information is available, then navigationally significant information such as navigational aids, fairways, regulated areas, etc. can be encoded or modified within the *Caution Area* if time permits. A reference to a picture file may also be included, if required, using the attribute *pictorial representation* on the *Caution Area*.
* Alternatively, and if considered appropriate a *Restricted Area* feature (see clause 17.8), with attribute *restriction* = _7_ (entry prohibited) may be encoded instead of the *Caution Area* feature.

[start=3,type=a]
.. Simple information which does not need an additional notification of caution:

*** The relevant feature(s) and the appropriate attributes should be encoded with any additional contextual information provided using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6). In this case it is not necessary to use a *Caution Area* feature. This could apply, for example, to submarine cables or pipelines being laid (*Cable Submarine* or *Pipeline Submarine/On Land* features), or an area under reclamation (*Land Area* feature with attribute *condition* = _3_ (under reclamation)). If required the encoding should reflect that positions are approximate using the spatial attribute *quality of horizontal measurement*= _4_ (approximate) on the spatial type(s).
.. Depths less than those charted within a defined area:

* If the depth values and their positions are known, *Sounding* features (see clause 11.3) may be created or modified. Any affected depth contours and depth areas should also be amended as necessary. The source of the information should be encoded using the complex attribute *information* (see clause 2.4.6). However, Producing Authorities should carefully consider the time needed to update ENC depth information and the complexity of changes to the topology that may be required.
* The encoding of amended **Sounding**, *Depth Area* and associated features could be inappropriate for promulgating this navigationally significant information within acceptable time scales. In this case a *Caution Area* (see clause 16.10) is the preferred option. In such cases, only the most significant amendments to depth information should be provided using the complex attribute **i****nformation**. This method should also be used if the depth values and/or the exact positions are unknown, or if the Producing Authority only has information relating to a limited number of depth values.

==== ECDIS Chart 1 custom features

If it is required to encode a custom feature required, for example, to encode supporting features such as table structures and texts used in the ECDIS Chart 1 datasets, it must be done using the feature *Chart 1 Feature*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The *Chart 1 Feature* must only be used for specific purposes such as within test datasets and the ECDIS Chart 1 datasets. It is prohibited to use *Chart 1 Feature* in navigational ENC datasets.
* The attribute *drawing instruction* must be populated, if required, with one or more symbol instructions as defined in S-100 Part 9a.
* If it is required for textual information related to a *Chart 1 Feature* instance to be included in the ECDIS display, this must be done by populating the complex attribute **feature name**, sub-attribute *name usage* with value _1_ (default name display) for the *feature name* instance. To locate the text at the appropriate position (for example for an instance of *Chart 1 Feature* encoded only to include textual information in the dataset), this must be done, if required, using an associated instance of the Cartographic feature *Text Placement* (see clause 23.1). If it is required to restrict the inclusion of the contents of *feature name* only to the ECDIS Pick Report, *name usage* must not be populated for the *feature name* instance. See also clause 2.5.8.
